This repository contains a coding agent focused on output quality, built for professional engineers.

The product philosophy is:
- minimal restrictions on model behavior: enabling the model to do its work unhindered.
- extensible architecture with low-friction composition that enables easy future feature additions.
- transparency of agent activity for power users, no fluff, no fancy UI tweaks, productivity and long-running work focus.

The scope is intentionally narrow and quality-oriented.

## Repository Layout
- `cli/app`
  - Startup orchestration, auth gating, session selection, and top-level UI composition.
- `server/runtime`
  - Agent step loop, retries, transcript assembly, tool orchestration, lock handling, interrupts.
- `server/bootstrap`
  - Server-owned embedded bootstrap composition for config/container resolution, auth-manager creation, and runtime-support setup shared by CLI flows.
- `server/embedded`
  - Explicit in-process app-server composition root used by the CLI in embedded mode; owns startup orchestration across bootstrap/auth/onboarding hooks and exposes server capabilities to frontends.
- `server/authflow`
  - Server-owned auth readiness loop and env-backed auth-store policy used by CLI auth UX.
- `server/lifecycle`
  - Server-owned interactive lifecycle mutations such as draft persistence, rollback fork creation, and logout-state clearing.
- `server/runtimeview`
  - Server-owned projection from runtime-native events and chat snapshots into client-facing UI DTOs.
- `server/launch`
  - Server-owned bootstrap continuation resolution and session open/create/hydration planning shared by interactive and headless flows.
- `server/runtimewire`
  - Server-owned runtime preparation, local tool registry construction, background-event routing, outside-workspace approvals, and runtime event bridging.
- `server/session`
  - Session persistence (`events.jsonl`) and resume/list primitives.
- `server/tools`
  - Tool contracts and concrete tools (`shell`, `patch`, `ask_question`).
- `server/llm`
  - Model-facing contracts and OpenAI transport/client adapters.
- `server/auth`
  - Global auth state, method switching policy, startup gate, OAuth refresh plumbing.
- `cli/tui`
  - Mode-specific UI behavior (`ongoing`/`detail`) and rendering helpers.
- `shared/config`
  - Persistence root/workspace container resolution and app-level paths.
- `shared/clientui`
  - Client-facing UI event and snapshot DTOs used by frontend adapters instead of runtime-native structs.
- `cli/actions`
  - Typed action registry scaffold for `ask_question` post-answer hooks.
- `docs`
  - Public Astro/Starlight documentation site. Authoritative internal product specs live under `docs/dev/specs`, process/engineering docs live under `docs/dev`, and scratch/internal working notes stay under `docs/tmp`. Keep docs up-to-date on your own and proactively.
- `apps`
  - GUI workspace for desktop/web client surfaces. `apps/desktop` contains the Tauri desktop app, `apps/desktop/packages/*` contains desktop-only shared packages, and `apps/shared/*` is reserved for packages shared by multiple GUI apps.
- `server/tools/definitions.go`
  - Centralized compile-time tool interface declarations (name, descriptions, JSON schemas).
- `docs/dev/specs/terminology.md` - DDD's ubiquitous language, must read during design phases to communicate with user.

## Engineering Principles
- Keep the model unburdened.
  - Prefer runtime contracts and deterministic infrastructure over prompt complexity. Minimize extra tools.
- Design for composability.
  - New tools and handlers should require minimal boilerplate and minimal cross-cutting edits.
- Maximize API cache hits, avoid mutation of past conversation history, including tool lists, system prompts.
- Keep TUI fast, avoid flicker, stable scroll, build adaptive layouts, avoid affecting scrollback buffer in ongoing mode or re-emitting full history.
- Never use regex-based matching, parsing, replace hacks. Never use substring-based lookup to determine information presence. Avoid brittle and fragile text/string-based logic, and develop type-safe data structures, store structured data or metadata that can reliably be extracted instead.
-  Breaking changes are allowed, but the UX of migration should be straightforward, e.g. a migration note for config entries or a clear error message. Ask user what migration strategy they want.

## Coding Guidelines
- Prefer robust, forward-compatible, reusable, well-architected implementations over hacks, one-shot, temporary fixes or features bolted onto the existing arch.
- Keep modules cohesive; each package should have one primary responsibility.
- Introduce interfaces where they reduce coupling, not by default.
- Make failure paths explicit, observable. Handle and surface errors cleanly. Write easy to understand error messages for both the model and the operator.
- Maintain good user experience when adding new features (e.g. display loading states, events or ongoing processes).
- Validate invariants at boundaries (input, filesystem, process execution, API responses).
- Keep behavior configurable only when it serves real operator value.
- GUI clients are remote-control surfaces over Builder server APIs/read models. The server remains authoritative for runtime, worktrees, DB, orchestration, validation, approvals, asks, workflow state, scheduling, and persistence.
- Tauri/native APIs must stay behind GUI-side bridge packages; do not import Tauri APIs directly from feature components.
- Desktop GUI chrome must use a fixed window shell with scrollable islands/panes. Do not restore global/document/root scrolling for desktop GUI overscroll experiments; it makes macOS traffic lights overlap content and is rejected.
- GUI pagination must use infinite scroll. Do not add page-number, next/previous, "Load more", or other button-based pagination controls.
- Use browser-client QA as the primary manual GUI QA path. Run `pnpm --dir apps/desktop dev:browser` for interactive QA, or `./scripts/capture-gui-browser-proof.sh` for agent-browser screenshot proof capture against an existing Builder server.

## Commit guidelines
Format: `<type>[!]: [description]`, `!` = breaking change (requiring migration from users of Builder).
Use one of these types for all commits: `feat`, `fix`, `feat!`/`breaking`/`api`, `docs`,  `refactor`,  `chore`.
Examples: `feat: add state recovery`, `feat!: change Saver API`
If user asks you to fix a github issue and you commit the fix, use 'closes #xx' in description.

## Important rules:
- All business logic covered by tests. Production code is written to be unit-testable.
- Use red/green TDD when developing new features.
- Never write tests that assert literal prompt strings, log lines, colors, styles, or other textual/visual content. Such tests check the wording of an artifact rather than its behavior, break on every copy edit, and provide no signal — the prompt/log itself is the source of truth. Test behavior, parsing, structure, or invariants instead.
- Before handing off to the user after Go code changes, rebuild via `./scripts/build.sh --output ./bin/builder`. Don't ask for confirmation to run/write tests and run checks.
- Run tests via `./scripts/test.sh` passing normal go test arguments. With no package args this also runs GUI frontend tests.
- Releases are driven by `VERSION`; keep Homebrew release plumbing in sync with `scripts/update-brew-tap.sh` and the tap formula. Tap formula lives in a separate repo.
- `docs/dev/specs/` is the source of truth for locked product and architecture decisions. Keep the relevant area spec up to date when the user makes a new decision.
- Ongoing mode must not use `?1007`.
- Ongoing normal-buffer transcript history is append-only after startup. Once a line is emitted into scrollback, it is immutable: never retroactively restyle it, rewrite it, clear-and-replay it, or re-emit the full buffer to reflect later tool state.
- Proactively keep documentation up-to-date on your own when you make UX or other user-facing changes. Example areas that warrant a docs check include setup, startup, config, env variables, slash commands, model providers, worktrees, server arch, etc.
- Full transcript history is unbounded & weighs gigabytes, thus no code must ever attempt to load `events.jsonl` fully into memory.
- Model request assembly must preserve persisted conversation items in order for provider prompt-cache continuity. Do not add request-time filters that remove or replace historical reminders/context messages to keep only the latest state; append new model-visible context or rotate cache keys at explicit boundaries instead.
- Do not add request-time sanitizers over persisted conversation/tool items. ANSI stripping and command-output cleanup belong in shell post-processing before tool results are persisted, not in model request assembly.
- Do not add provider-adapter history shapers in model request serialization. Provider-specific input payload shape must be materialized at transcript/persistence projection boundaries; provider adapters serialize prepared items and fail invalid unprepared items instead of silently dropping, promoting, prefixing, stringifying, or normalizing historical items.
- Runtime output mutations belong behind the `server/runtime` steer/queue boundary. Do not add ad-hoc appenders, prompt injectors, direct runtime event emitters, or bespoke queue flush paths for model-visible context, transcript rows, tool completions, local diagnostics, or runtime status events. Build typed steering intents; queues store those intents; compaction starts a new active list from compacting output and then steers runtime context into it.


- Keep this AGENTS.md file up-to-date and comprehensive. Avoid adding info that can become outdated, otherwise keep this as project guidelines, rules, and learnings for future team members. Persist info that should be preserved here.
