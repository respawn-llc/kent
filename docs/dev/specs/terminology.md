# Terminology

Use these terms consistently in specs, code names, CLI/API contracts, and implementation work.

## Workflow

### Task

A durable user-facing unit of work. A task owns workflow state, task metadata, node history, transition history, question associations, comments, and execution artifacts. Kent sessions are artifacts under a task.

### Task Short ID

A human-facing, project-scoped task identifier formed from the project key plus a project-local sequence, e.g. `KNT-123`. Assigned at task creation and immutable thereafter.

### Project Key

A short, human-facing, uppercase project prefix applied to new task short IDs. Unique within a persistence root.

### Workflow Version

A monotonic workflow definition counter incremented by persisted definition edits. Metadata-only changes and graph changes each increment it once, combined metadata+graph saves increment it once, and no-op saves do not increment it. It provides traceability for tasks, runs, transitions, approvals, and stale-warning UX without immutable graph versioning.

### Workflow

A durable directed graph that describes how tasks move through work. Workflows are top-level reusable definitions linked into projects.

### Workflow Draft

A workflow definition that can be saved while semantic validation reports graph or project-context errors. Drafts still satisfy hard storage invariants such as valid identifiers, references, enums, unique keys, and exactly one start node.

### Validation Context

The purpose for validating a workflow graph, such as draft editing, task creation, or execution scheduling. Contexts can report the same errors while choosing different blocking behavior.

### Project Workflow Link

An active project association with a reusable workflow definition. The link lets a project use a workflow without copying the workflow graph and is the task's project/workflow pairing source of truth.

### Assignee

The subagent role associated with an executable node. UI surfaces may present the role as the node's assignee.

### Node

A workflow graph state. Agent, start, and terminal nodes can map to user-visible workflow states or Kanban columns/statuses. Join nodes are internal merge plumbing omitted from board columns and shown in workflow editor visuals as inspectable merge nodes. Node identity is execution identity.

### Node Group

A workflow editor grouping around related graph nodes. GUI-authored node groups are execution-shaped parallel groups: they contain branch nodes and one join, and the fan-out is represented by one fan-out transition. A one-node group may exist only as an unsaved draft editing state.

### Start Node

The node where new tasks enter a workflow. A start node is non-executable and has no authored parameters.

### Task Start

An explicit operation that moves a newly created task from start/backlog into the first executable placement by applying the start node's outgoing transition.

### Terminal Node

A sink node where workflow automation stops.

### Edge

A directed graph primitive from a source node to a target node. Kent UI surfaces call user-facing edges transition branches; graph libraries and persistence may use edge terminology at adapter and storage boundaries.

### Transition

A source-node decision that moves a task toward one or more target nodes. A normal transition has one transition branch. A fan-out transition has multiple branches selected together.

### Transition Branch

One target branch of a transition. The branch owns target-specific invocation behavior such as target node, prompt applicability, parameters, context preservation, context source, routing, and join behavior.

### Fan-Out Transition

A transition with multiple branches that starts parallel target placements from one source-node decision.

### Parameter

A stable-key string fact produced by an agent source when it applies a transition. Parameters are declared on transition branches, are required when declared, and can be used by target prompts, previous-transition prompt references, joins, terminal transition history, and validation.

### Transition Prompt

A prompt template owned by a transition branch into an agent node. Transitions into non-agent nodes do not have prompts.

### Transition Result

Structured data produced by a node run for a selected transition. It includes the selected transition key when the source node has multiple outgoing transitions, optional `commentary`, and top-level parameter values required by the selected transition.

### Parameter Requirements

Runtime requirements for transition parameters that must be present before the run can continue. Parameter requirements are derived from the selected transition and its fan-out branches.

### Parameter Binding

A runtime mapping from a transition parameter key to the value made available to a target prompt or join aggregate.

### Transition Key

A stable workflow-wide key for a transition. Agent nodes emit transition keys when more than one outgoing transition is available. Prompt templates use transition keys to reference previous-transition parameters.

### Transition Label

The human-facing label for a transition. Labels are display text; transition keys are stable contract identifiers.

### Transition Branch Key

A stable key for one branch inside a fan-out transition. Branch keys distinguish target branches in editor visuals, routing, and join aggregation.

### Context-Preservation Mode

Per-transition-branch policy for the next node's execution context:

- `new_session`: start a blank Kent session and inject the previous transition result plus task metadata.
- `continue_session`: continue a selected previous Kent session with a new prompt/goal and bound metadata.
- `compact_and_continue_session`: compact the selected previous session first, then continue with a new prompt/goal and bound metadata.

### Context Source

Per-transition-branch policy deciding which earlier run supplies the source session for continuation modes. `immediate_source` uses the run that produced the selected transition. `node:<node_key>` selects the latest completed run for a guaranteed-prior agent node. `previous_target` selects the latest completed run of the transition branch target.

### Run

One durable execution attempt for a node on a task. A run may create or continue a Kent session, call tools, ask questions, produce a transition result, and terminate with a structured outcome.

### Interrupted Run

A run stopped before producing a valid transition result. Its session and worktree state remain available so execution can continue from the interruption point.

### Session Contract

The immutable execution setup captured by a Kent session after its first model request: model/provider setup, generation parameters, tool schema snapshot, and system/developer prompt snapshot.

### Runtime Parameter Contract

The run-start snapshot of possible and required transition parameters for a node run. Runtime parameter contracts are derived from outgoing transitions, fan-out branch unions, previous-transition references, and join aggregates, then frozen for in-flight work.

### Run Start Context

The typed aggregate materialized for the runner before a workflow run starts. It combines task, run, node, workspace/worktree, run-start snapshot, accepted transition branch invocation facts, parameter values, context-preservation mode, and context source provenance. It is a store materialization interface, not an opaque persisted JSON envelope.

### Session

Kent transcript/runtime artifact used by a run. A task may have many sessions because of loops, branches, retries, or context-preservation choices.

### Session Run

One live execution of a session through the runtime loop. A session can have multiple runtime activations over time through resume, queued user submissions, goal turns, compaction, or background continuation.

### Node Transition

A task movement from one node to another through a transition branch. It evaluates transition conditions, applies parameter bindings, applies context preservation, and schedules or blocks the next run.

### Node Placement

An occurrence of a task in a node. A task can have multiple active placements only when a workflow explicitly runs parallel branches.

### Parallel Batch

The branch placements created by one fan-out transition for one task. The batch gives joins a correlation identity.

### Join

A non-agent fan-in node that waits for required inbound branches before continuing. The join exposes a read-only aggregate of incoming branch parameters. Same-key incoming parameter collisions are invalid.

### Task Cancellation

A task-level stop operation that prevents further automation, interrupts active runs with cancellation metadata, and archives the task to terminal/Done for board visibility.

### Question

A user-blocking ask emitted by a run through `ask_question`. Questions carry prompt text, optional suggestions/options, optional recommended option index, and schema-backed answer expectations.

### Orchestrator

An agent node whose transition prompts ask it to coordinate work. Orchestration may happen inside one agent run or through workflow graph branches.

### Operational Stop State

A workflow/task state where auto-execution stops because the task is done, interrupted, blocked, or awaiting manual/user action.

### Scheduler

Server-owned automation scheduler. Runnable work is derived from durable task/run state; pending-work ordering and active runtime ownership are live scheduler/runtime state.

### Task Comment

A durable task-local note. Task comments are hard-deleted notes, not source-run artifacts, tombstones, or opaque metadata containers.

## GUI

### Toast

A transient or persistent global notification surfaced by the desktop app. Toast and snackbar are equivalent terms in Kent GUI docs and code.

## TUI And Transcript

### Ongoing Mode

Primary long-running TUI mode backed by normal-buffer terminal scrollback. Ongoing mode appends committed transcript history and live overlays without owning a scrollable viewport or rewriting emitted lines.

### Detail Mode

Transcript inspection mode with UI-local selection, expansion, and line-oriented viewport scrolling. Detail content can update while open, but scroll/anchor behavior stays stable unless the user navigates.

### Transcript Mode

The rendering posture for transcript entries. Current modes are ongoing and detail.

### Alternate Screen

Terminal buffer separate from normal scrollback. Kent avoids alternate screen for ongoing mode so persistent history remains in native terminal scrollback.

### Alternate Scroll

Terminal mode `?1007`, which converts wheel input into cursor-key style events in alternate-screen contexts. Every alternate-screen surface enables alternate scroll while active and disables it on exit, so wheel input scrolls the surface through its cursor-key handlers. The only exceptions are ongoing mode, which never enables it, and the rollback/edit picker, which renders inside alt-screen but ignores mouse and keeps alternate scroll off.

### Mouse Capture

Terminal mode where the app receives mouse events instead of leaving them to native terminal selection. Kent keeps mouse capture disabled in ongoing and detail modes.

### Normal Buffer

Terminal buffer with native scrollback. Ongoing mode renders committed history here and treats emitted lines as immutable.

### Scrollback

Terminal-owned history of normal-buffer output. Kent does not replay, clear, or restyle committed ongoing scrollback after startup.

## Runtime Steering And Goals

### Active Session Runtime

The live runtime a session registers while it is running. It exists independently of who is driving it: a run owner may hold it, or it may be registered but idle between activations.

### Run Owner

The headless or workflow run that holds the session's primary-run lease for the whole run and drives the runtime loop. While a run owns the session, no other writer drives the step loop.

### Limited-Control Attach

An interactive client attached to a session whose active runtime is owned by a run. It gets a live view plus steering (queued user messages) and the allowed controls (goal, settings, compaction, worktree, process view), but not controller ownership. A limited-control attach to a running workflow task may steer and chat as usual; the only workflow-specific limit is that the model cannot submit a structured-output final answer that is invalid for the node. When no active runtime is reachable for an attach, the failure surfaces as the typed runtime-unavailable error, not internal wording.

### Goal

A persistent self/user-declared objective with a continuation loop (nudges, suspend/resume, premature-stop reminders) that drives turns until the goal is completed, paused, or cleared. A goal may be set by the user or by the model itself, including inside a workflow run.

### Goal Continuation Loop

The driver that re-runs the step loop to keep working a goal across runs, injecting goal reminders. It does not run while a workflow run owns the session — the workflow turn loop is the single continuation driver there, and the goal stays a passive objective folded into the workflow's continuation nudge.
