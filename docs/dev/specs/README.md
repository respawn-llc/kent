# Product Specs

These docs are the authoritative, searchable product-decision source for Kent agents.
When product behavior and a specification disagree, the specification governs.

Before writing, rewriting, reviewing, or validating a spec, follow the
[spec-writing skill](../../../.kent/skills/spec-writing/SKILL.md).

Area specs:

- `core-runtime-tools.md`: product scope, sessions, authentication, configuration, tools, runtime control, and compaction.
- `provider-connections.md`: named provider access, connection selection, credentials, Session binding, terminal login, and configuration cutover.
- `runtime-steering-loop.md`: Active Session Runtime mutation ownership, accepted mutation order, protected Agent Steps, Step Boundaries, and next-Step selection.
- `cli-commands.md`: CLI command behavior, accepted inputs, human output, machine-readable output, and exit codes.
- `project-workspaces.md`: Project-workspace relationships, detach safety, and API selection.
- `tui-transcript.md`: terminal modes, transcript visibility, rendering, input, slash commands, worktrees, notifications.
- `tui-startup.md`: interactive TUI launch, authentication, project binding, session selection, and attach behavior.
