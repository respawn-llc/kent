# Core Runtime And Tools Spec

## Authority And Client Boundaries

- Kent does not virtualize or sandbox command execution. Isolation requires running Kent on a remote machine or in Docker.
- The server is the single authority for tool calls, session and other durable data, agent execution, and provider communication. CLI and GUI clients control and observe that authority; they do not own parallel local state or execution.
- Client presence and connection lifecycle are transport-only and are never server-work authority. Connecting, disconnecting, canceling or closing a client request, reconnecting, changing subscriber count, navigating away, or closing a UI may stop that client's observation or delivery only; it never starts, stops, pauses, cancels, retries, replays, duplicates, authorizes, or otherwise changes server-owned work. The detached Session archive lifetime defined by the [CLI Commands](cli-commands.md) specification is the sole exception. Server event publication never depends on subscriber count.
- Core owns each Chat Operation from target resolution through attachment finalization. A Chat Operation continues independently after caller timeout, request cancellation, transport loss, navigation, or client shutdown.
- Core shutdown atomically stops accepting new Chat Operations, cancels every in-flight Chat Operation, and joins them before closing Runtime Authority, metadata, or another dependency used by those operations.
- During Core shutdown, each Chat Operation must finish any acquired Runtime attachment through a bounded finalization attempt before the operation joins. A finalization failure remains an operator-visible shutdown diagnostic and does not create replay, reconciliation, or another owner.
- Explicit Runtime activation may retain the selected Session Runtime for the activating client connection. Disconnecting that connection detaches its retention without closing the Runtime or changing its work. An explicit Runtime Release is the separate operation that may drop the owner and close an idle Runtime.
- A completed live execution has one server-authoritative terminal result: status, result kind, reason that no final answer exists, final assistant message, runtime error, timestamps, and whether work was performed. Work was performed when a completed step observed at least two tool-start events, including events emitted during recovery.
- Terminal-result delivery is best-effort and never delays execution completion, waiting callers, queued work, interruption, or successor scheduling.
- Each controlling TUI may run its configured read-only lifecycle command after it accepts a lifecycle event. Desktop, headless, subagent, and server-only use never run it. The server neither supplies nor overrides the command.
- Each client transcript subscription is ordered and sequence-numbered. Hydration is the first message. Every later update has the next per-subscription sequence number; each update contains the required content, tool completions appear in committed order, and committed assistant entries retain the identity of their streamed output. Clients apply every received message once and in order. Clients receive neither total transcript counts nor absolute offsets or revisions.
- Opening or reopening Chat obtains an ordered, sequence-numbered transcript hydration and independently loads the latest completed server-owned projections for RuntimeActivity, Session identity and status, execution target, active execution, reasoning, Reviewer, compaction, tool, Queue, prompt, background-process, context-usage, and Goal state.
- The non-transcript projections may be stale and may represent different completed moments. Server authority identifies the owner of each fact and does not promise read freshness or a cross-owner snapshot.
- A live Runtime may also report current Reviewer activity as best-effort state without reconstructing an earlier review from transcript history or promising that reconnect observes it.
- Feed delivery state never replaces authoritative Session facts.
- Transcript delivery does not promise lossless continuity across subscription establishment, disconnection, process failure, or recovery. When a client detects discontinuity, it reopens the ordered transcript subscription and reissues the independent owner reads instead of relying on cached feed state.
- A Session with no execution target hydrates without one. Failure to resolve an execution target fails Chat opening or reopening with a clear error; Kent does not fabricate a target.
- Clients receive transcript, session-activity, and prompt-activity updates in one ordered subscription.
- Active Session Runtime mutation and model-loop ownership follow the [Runtime Steering And Model Loop](runtime-steering-loop.md) specification. Dormant Session mutations and long-running operations remain with their concrete domain owners.
- Transport may correlate one request with one response, sequence connection setup, bound concurrent handling on one connection, apply socket backpressure, and stop connection-bound waiting and delivery when that connection closes. It never cancels a Chat Operation, rolls back a committed Session, or changes accepted work. Transport correlation is not a product identity, replay key, domain order, or server-work owner.

## Skills And Generated Assets

- Skills are discovered from `<persistence-root>/skills` (default `~/.kent/skills`), workspace `.kent/skills`, and `<persistence-root>/.generated/skills`. Global `AGENTS.md` and the global system-prompt file use the selected persistence root; an empty root means `~/.kent`. Symlinks are followed when these files are discovered or read.
- File-only `[skills]` boolean settings enable or disable a skill for new-session model context. Disabled skills remain visible in clients.
- The generated `prompting` skill owns on-demand prompt-writing and agent-coordination guidance. Its enabled or disabled state must affect only ordinary skill visibility; it must not select system-prompt content, role guidance, reminders, or other model context.
- System-prompt templates must continue to accept `DefaultSystemPromptDelegation` and render it as empty text, independent of skill visibility.
- Kent seeds preinstalled skills into `<persistence-root>/.generated/skills`. This generated directory is overwritten whenever the server starts, is not user-owned, and must not be edited. A user skill with the same normalized name shadows its generated skill.
- Model file-edit tools refuse writes in `<persistence-root>/.generated` without requesting approval. The refusal explains that generated files are overwritten and that a skill must be shadowed from an active user skill path using the same normalized name, ID, and directory structure. This restriction does not apply to command execution or file reads.
- Generated-file protection can identify paths by exact path, glob pattern, or regular-expression pattern. Regular-expression matching in this protection policy is an explicit exception to the repository's general ban on regex parsing and replacement.
- If generated content is edited, deleted, renamed, linked, or invalid, Kent moves the generated tree to `<persistence-root>/recovered/<UTC timestamp>/.generated` and recreates it. A non-empty recovered directory causes each new session to show a user-only warning to clean recovered files and not edit `.generated`.
- Generated skills are always seeded; `[skills]` settings only control their model visibility. Empty files, invalid frontmatter, duplicate names, symlinks, and non-regular generated entries are rejected.

## Core Tools And Runtime Integration

- The core model tools are `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `view_image`, `patch`, `ask_question`, and `trigger_handoff`.
- Kent does not expose model-callable Goal, worktree, Task, or Workflow tools outside Workflow-controlled Sessions. Adding a tool requires explicit human approval and a spec update.
- Model/transcript-visible Session mutations follow the Active Session Runtime's accepted mutation order unless the Runtime Steering specification assigns the operation to an exact or direct owner.
- Tool definitions advertise one canonical tool name and canonical parameter names, and their schemas remain closed to unrecognized parameters. Kent accepts the hidden aliases below only for incoming model tool calls, and they do not expand accepted configuration names.
- Kent normalizes every accepted alias to its canonical tool and parameter names before execution, persistence, presentation, or later model context.
- Kent checks exact canonical spelling, listed semantic aliases in order, canonical camelCase forms, semantic-alias camelCase forms, and then case-insensitive forms. Every listed multiword canonical name and semantic alias also accepts its explicit kebab-case companion. Kent does not perform generic punctuation or fuzzy normalization.
- Canonical parameters and their accepted casing or separator forms take priority over semantic aliases. Precedence among multiple semantic aliases is unspecified. Unrecognized parameters are ignored when a call reaches Kent.
- An active tool whose published name exactly matches the incoming spelling takes priority over a hidden alias. `patch` and `edit` are mutually exclusive: `edit` aliases `patch` when `patch` is active and remains canonical when `edit` is active.
- Kent panics during startup in development and production when hidden aliases resolve one spelling to different tools, or parameter aliases within one tool resolve one spelling to different canonical parameters.
- Tool aliases are `exec_command`: `shell`, `bash`, `exec`, `run_command`, `shell_command`, `run_shell`, `bash_command`; `write_stdin`: none; `view_image`: `read_image`, `open_image`, `inspect_image`, `vision`, `read_pdf`, `open_pdf`, `inspect_pdf`; `patch`: `apply_patch`, `edit`; `ask_question`: `question`, `ask_user_question`, `request_user_input`, `ask`, `ask_user`, `ask_human`, `help`, `say`; `trigger_handoff`: `handoff`, `compact`, `request_handoff`; and `edit`: `edit_file`, `str_replace_editor`, `replace`, `string_replace`, `replace_text`, `write`.
- Parameter aliases are `exec_command`: `cmd` from `command`, `script`; `workdir` from `cwd`, `working_directory`, `working_dir`; `shell` from `shell_path`, `interpreter`; `login` from `login_shell`; `tty` from `pty`, `use_tty`; `raw` from `raw_output`; `yield_time_ms` from `yield_ms`, `wait_ms`; `max_output_tokens` from `max_tokens`, `output_token_limit`; `write_stdin`: `session_id` from `process_id`, `shell_id`; `chars` from `input`, `stdin`, `text`; `yield_time_ms` from `yield_ms`, `wait_ms`; `max_output_tokens` from `max_tokens`, `output_token_limit`; `view_image`: `path` from `file_path`, `image_path`, `file`, `pdf_path`, `filename`; `raw` from `raw_output`, `unoptimized`, `disable_optimization`, `original_quality`; `patch`: `patch` from `diff`, `patch_text`, `content`, `patch_content`, `input`; `edit`: `path` from `file_path`, `file`; `old_string` from `old_text`, `find`, `search`; `new_string` from `new_text`, `replacement`, `replace`; `replace_all` from `all`, `global`; `ask_question`: `question` from `prompt`, `message`, `text`; `suggestions` from `options`, `choices`, `answers`; `recommended_option_index` from `recommended_index`, `suggested_option_index`, `default_index`; and `trigger_handoff`: `summarizer_prompt` from `summary_prompt`, `handoff_prompt`, `compaction_prompt`; `future_agent_message` from `next_agent_message`, `handoff_message`, `continuation_message`.
- The canonical parameter `yield_time_ms` also accepts the mixed separator form `yield-time_ms`, its full-kebab form `yield-time-ms`, and its generated camelCase form `yieldTimeMs`.
- `steer` applies submitted input through that accepted mutation order.
- `queue` remains the separate post-turn user Queue.
- A human steer remains one user message and applies as one first-in, first-out Session mutation.
- A `kent run steer` invoked from another Session must emit each accepted submission as a separate developer-role `agent_steer` message in submission order.
- A `kent run` invoked from another Session must submit its assignment as the same developer-role `agent_steer` message, whether it creates a Session or continues an existing Session.
- Human-started Run prompts must remain user messages.
- Kent must not rewrite existing conversation history to change sender attribution.
- An agent-issued Run assignment or steer must contain exactly:

```text
Agent from another session said:
> <submitted text>

You can use `kent run steer <source-session-id> "message"` to respond.
```

- Kent must insert one literal `>` followed by one space immediately before the submitted text. It must not add quote markers to later lines.
- The message includes the source Session ID and omits its name.
- A present malformed `KENT_SESSION_ID` fails `kent run steer` before submission. An absent or blank value uses the human-steer behavior.
- Prompt history stores the complete wrapped message.
- Tool lifecycle effects, Runtime notices, additions after history replacement, and other model/transcript-visible results enter through the owning Agent Step or accepted Session mutation order.
- Line-by-line Markdown streaming remains transient presentation rather than a committed Runtime mutation.
- A Kent-executed tool call is durable before Kent begins its execution. Provider-hosted work may already be complete when Kent receives its outcome; that outcome follows the same compatible Result Group durability as Kent-executed results. Kent commits compatible complete tool results from one Agent Step in one or more ordered Result Groups; an Agent Turn is never a Result Group. Each result keeps its completion, model-visible output, and attached operator diagnostic together, whether it reports success or error.
- Result Groups preserve provider-required order and otherwise the Agent Step's stable result order. Clients and later model requests see no part of a Result Group before the complete Result Group is durable.
- A dormant Goal command is the sole persisted-transcript exception outside an Active Session Runtime: the server atomically confirms that no current agent resource owns the Session, then persists the durable Goal transition and one Goal notice without creating a runtime, live event, transaction, rollback, repair, retry, or extra admission lock. A concurrent live release surfaces its error rather than re-admitting.
- Runtime notices that are not model-visible remain in the transcript. A client never replays a Runtime Command after it loses the result or reconnects. After reconnect, the client reissues Session reads and subscriptions. A later explicit user submission creates a new Runtime Command.
- Input accepted before workflow completion becomes final supersedes that pending completion and continues the same Exact Execution Scope. Input submitted after that point, or while the scope is closing, receives a retryable rejection so the client restores its draft; it never reaches a successor Node or Session.
- History replacement is atomic from the model's perspective: replacement content and its new context become the next ordered conversation state together. Persisted transcript order never changes.
- Instant Stop, pending-input disposition, Runtime retirement, and loss behavior follow the Runtime Steering specification.

## Command Execution

- `exec_command` is the only model-facing command-execution tool. It uses the user's login shell without a TTY, inherits the parent environment, adds non-interactive technical environment values, and combines stdout and stderr into one unlabelled stream.
- Before launching a command, Kent must resolve a non-empty selected Working Directory to a normalized absolute path and verify that the path exists and is a directory.
- If a non-empty selected Working Directory does not exist, Kent must not launch the command and must return `<normalized absolute path> does not exist, so the shell command was not executed. Please select an existing working directory`.
- If a non-empty selected Working Directory exists but is not a directory, Kent must not launch the command and must return `<normalized absolute path> is not a directory, so the shell command was not executed. Please select an existing working directory`.
- An empty selected Working Directory is validated by the shell manager and never falls back to Kent's server process working directory.
- An `exec_command` failure never adds the `exec_command failed:` prefix to its model-visible error.
- Commands have no lifetime limit. For `exec_command`, omitted `yield_time_ms` uses the default wait, explicit `null` waits until completion, `0` backgrounds immediately, and a positive duration waits up to that many milliseconds before backgrounding a command that remains running.
- This wait policy applies only to new command launches. An output check with no requested wait may return available output immediately.
- Kent does not limit concurrent command processes, including background processes visible through `/ps`.
- A foreground command may run while later short Session settings, human input, and model-visible notices are accepted and applied.
- Kent applies a foreground command's terminal output or typed failure before another provider request starts.
- After a command moves to the background, it no longer blocks unrelated provider or tool work.
- The process owner later records and delivers the background terminal result when the Session can still receive it.
- A model output check requesting less than 15 seconds fails with `Avoid polling repeatedly for short intervals, prefer 3-15min polls depending on task. Pick a better interval and retry`. One requesting more than 24 hours fails with `This poll is too long. Consider using system cron jobs and \`kent run\` headless runs for tasks that require such long wait periods`. Sending input is not subject to those limits.
- A non-zero command exit is recoverable and does not abort the model turn. Launch failures are not retried automatically. Interruption sends `SIGINT`, then `SIGKILL` after 10 seconds.
- `[shell].postprocessing_mode` accepts only `none`, `builtin`, `user`, or `all`; omission selects the built-in default, while an empty or unknown value is an error. `[shell].postprocess_hook` is optional; absence is `null`, and a present empty or whitespace-only value is invalid.
- Each command captures its effective post-processing settings when it starts. That captured policy applies consistently to foreground output, background output, later `write_stdin` polls, completion notices, and shutdown processing, even if settings, role, or workspace change. `raw=true` bypasses that policy in every one of those paths.
- Except in `none` and `raw` modes, generic command-output sanitization runs before built-ins and the optional hook. Built-ins run before the hook; a built-in halt stops only later built-ins. In `user` and `all` modes, Kent runs the user-hook stage only when `[shell].postprocess_hook` is configured; an omitted hook silently skips that stage. A user hook receives JSON on stdin containing the original sanitized and current processed output, and returns JSON on stdout. If a configured hook executable is missing, times out, exits nonzero, or returns invalid JSON, Kent preserves the current model-facing output and reports a warning.
- `/ps` shows background processes whose owning Session belongs to the selected Project and operates on processes selected from that list.
- Process recent-output previews are UTF-8 text. A preview preserves valid UTF-8 and replaces each contiguous run of invalid bytes with one Unicode replacement character. This preview projection does not change raw shell output, retained logs, Inline Output, or raw byte offsets.
- Background process IDs are unique for one server lifetime. Their Session association controls Project list membership, notices, and history. Process termination uses the process ID without revalidating Project membership.
- Kent exposes at most 1,000 completed background processes per server lifetime. Completing another process removes the least recently directly accessed completed process and its retained log and completion output from `/ps` and process controls.
- Kent performs terminal event creation, delivery/finalization, and only then retention eviction and artifact cleanup.
- Direct process access refreshes completed-process recency. Listing `/ps` does not refresh recency.
- The completed-process retention limit never removes a running process.
- Accessing an unknown or removed process returns the same shell-result-unavailable error.
- Artifact-cleanup failures remain shell-owner operator diagnostics. Runtime Steering does not own or retry that cleanup.

## Patch And Image Tools

- `patch` applies atomically: malformed or conflicting patches leave files unchanged. It supports add, update, move, and delete; resolves real paths before validating targets; has no timeout; and is not retried automatically.
- Native file operations within the Session's Execution Target Root or any Workspace included in the Session's Project Workspace collection do not require approval. Attached Workspaces omitted by the Project Workspace collection limit use the ordinary approval policy. Outside that boundary, `patch` and `edit` require approval unless `allow_non_cwd_edits=true`, while `view_image` follows the same rule for reads. All three tools also allow targets under the operating system's temporary roots and their canonical platform aliases without approval; Kent recognizes aliases such as `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` and `/var/tmp` and `/private/var/tmp` where those paths exist. The temporary-root allowance does not add those paths to the Project Workspace collection, override path-deny rules, or permit direct edits to another Kent-managed Worktree. The default for `allow_non_cwd_edits` is `false`. A denied edit returns an explicit error telling the model not to circumvent the decision and to request manual user edits when essential.
- An edit that targets another Kent-managed Worktree is forbidden even when that Worktree belongs to a Workspace attached to the same Project.
- `patch` and `edit` deny every target under the Worktree Base Dir loaded at server startup unless the target is inside the Session's current Worktree. This denial applies to a sibling Worktree created after the Session starts, and it occurs before any outside-Workspace approval.
- `view_image` resolves absolute canonical paths before checking access. Workspace checks happen after symlink resolution, so symlink escapes outside the Session's Execution Target Root and the Workspaces included in the Session's Project Workspace collection remain outside the trusted boundary. Image reads use the same Project boundary and approval policy as edits.
- A Session Runtime prepares its Project Workspace collection once. Native file tools do not query Project metadata for each target because file operations must not add metadata contention.
- Approved outside-workspace image reads appear in run logs with the requested and resolved paths.
- `view_image` opens and reads each local file in an isolated worker. Kent terminates the worker and returns a recoverable tool error when opening or reading takes longer than 10 seconds or the Agent Step is interrupted.
- When a successful patch cannot accurately describe its whole-file deletion count, Kent never invents a count or reverses the filesystem change. Debug mode fails fast with diagnostics. Production preserves the successful path-only result, records an operator diagnostic excluded from model context, and continues.
- For supported non-raw raster images of at least 100 KiB, `view_image` attempts JPEG or WEBP re-encoding after validation. Kent keeps the validated original when optimization fails or is not smaller, and always enforces the attachment-size limit.

## Tool Output And Failure Behavior

- Kent truncates large tool output for model context with standardized head/tail content and truncation metadata. The threshold is configurable and applies after command post-processing.
- Foreground shell output is evaluated after sanitization, post-processing, warnings, truncation, and presentation trimming. Whitespace-only content is no output.
- Each `shell` and `write_stdin` call independently applies the oversized-output guard after output processing and ordinary truncation. The guard carries no state between calls.
- The oversized-output threshold is half of the active Session's established context window.
- The oversized-output guard is eligible only when the current call explicitly requests `max_output_tokens` above the threshold.
- For an eligible call, Kent applies its standard token estimate to the final model-visible result. When that estimate exceeds the threshold, Kent omits all command output and returns a failed tool result.
- An oversized-output failure must say `Command was executed but the output you requested exceeded 0.5 of your memory size. It was forcibly truncated still to prevent your memory overload, and the output written to ${command.output_path} . Next time be more careful with larger outputs.`, replacing `${command.output_path}` with the retained shell-log path.
- An oversized-output failure never stops a running command or changes command execution, the complete shell log, or later independent polls.
- The oversized-output guard does not alter a call when `max_output_tokens` is omitted, the requested cap is at or below the threshold, or the estimated final result is at or below the threshold.
- A successful foreground command with output returns only that plaintext. Any completed foreground command without output returns `Exit code N, no output.`. An unsuccessful foreground command with output returns `Exit code N, output:` followed by the output.
- Background completion and polling always include the exit code. Completion with no output says `Exit code N, no output.`. Lifecycle facts remain separate from output summaries.
- Completed background polling with output must list wall time, the output-file path when available, and `Exit code N, output:` in that order, followed by the command output.
- Concise background output may hide an inline preview, but completion must expose the exit code and output-file location when output exists and must not claim there was no output. Recoverable warnings remain visible and count as output, but do not imply command-log content.
- An invalid background-completion state fails fast with diagnostics in debug mode. Production preserves the terminal process facts, records the diagnostic, and reports an explicit Kent error instead of inventing successful or empty output.
- Transient model-step failures retry after `1s`, `2s`, `4s`, `8s`, and `16s`. Ongoing mode shows concise model/API errors; detail and logs retain full details.
- After a provider HTTP 400, Kent may append error results for tool calls that were interrupted without output only when no matching live operation remains, rebuild the request, and retry. Each synthetic error uses the original call's output kind and states that the call was interrupted with no output. Kent never rewrites or removes history, never fabricates success, and leaves matching live operations alone. A 400 without missing outputs surfaces unchanged. Each live repair records a user-only warning with the number of closed calls.
- Before another provider request, Agent Step completion, history replacement, compaction, Question, Approval, or Workflow effect, every compatible complete tool result already owned by the current Agent Step is durable. A delayed background result becomes durable through its own Steering delivery rather than as part of an unrelated Agent Step.
- Interruption, user cancellation, provider failure, validation failure, and other recoverable errors still finish the Agent Step. Kent makes their honest interruption or error results, notices, and warnings durable before it exposes committed transcript entries or terminal presentation for that outcome.
- A persistence failure before a Result Group becomes durable leaves that Result Group absent from the committed transcript and from committed client presentation. Kent surfaces the persistence error, ends the Exact Execution Scope, and neither retries that persistence operation nor retains a new pending-persistence state. It does not invent a semantic terminal transcript outcome for the absent group.
- Once a Result Group is durable, later persistence observation or live-delivery failure never rolls it back or causes Kent to append it again. Reconnect and reopen hydration restore the authoritative committed Result Group.
- A failure while making an effect barrier durable blocks its pending Question, Approval, or Workflow effect and ends the Exact Execution Scope. Any already-durable Result Group remains authoritative and is never appended again.
- A failure that prevents a model turn from starting is persisted as a user-visible developer diagnostic. Local command and validation failures that do not block a turn remain ordinary errors.

## Questions And Approvals

- `ask_question` presents one shared question experience for model and runtime requests and pauses the active work until answered. Questions have no timeout or default cancellation.
- The model can ask ordinary freeform or suggested questions only. Internal approvals are not model-callable.
- Suggested questions support freeform commentary and use one-based `recommended_option_index`. In the TUI, `Tab` switches between suggestions and freeform editing. A recommendation uses a Success-colored marker and a faint recommended note; selecting that row also applies the ordinary selected-row style. Choosing empty freeform opens editing, and a freeform answer cannot be empty. Returning to suggestions preserves an unsent freeform draft.
- Internal approvals belong to the tool call they approve and use that Tool Call ID throughout presentation and answer submission. Each tool call may present at most one internal Approval during its lifetime. Kent fails before presentation when an internal Approval has no owning Tool Call ID. Ordinary Questions use the Tool Call ID of their own `ask_question` call. Internal approvals carry ordered typed options whose labels are authoritative. Outside-workspace access ordinarily offers `Allow once`, `Allow for this session`, and `Deny`, but clients render the labels in the live request and never reconstruct them from decisions.
- Before an outside-workspace tool call presents its Approval, Kent must discover every attempted path that requires approval. One Approval covers the complete path set. The disclosure preserves first-attempt order and includes each distinct path string supplied by the model once. Different aliases remain separate even when they resolve to one target. A repeated identical supplied path appears once. Each disclosed path includes its different real resolved path when applicable. `Allow once` authorizes the separately deduplicated canonical target set. Kent revalidates each disclosed path-to-target mapping before access. A changed target or a later undisclosed target fails the tool call visibly and never opens another Approval.
- A Question or Approval is not presented when its preceding durability barrier fails. Kent surfaces the failure, ends the affected exact execution, and does not replay the blocked interaction.
- A live Agent execution waiting for a Question or Approval remains interruptible even when no model or tool step is active.
- Ordinary Runtime Interrupt, Runtime Live Stop, Workflow Task Interrupt, Workflow Manual Move, an Approval answer, and a declined Approval race at the exact live tool call owner. An Approval action is accepted only after the waiting tool accepts its decision or cancellation and any selected session-wide grant takes effect. If the Approval action is accepted first, those effects occur once before Interrupt or Manual Move may stop any continuing tool work. If Interrupt or Manual Move closes the tool call first, the Approval submission is Skipped without applying commentary.
- Question origin is not shown in the UI. Stored answers explicitly include the selected option number and commentary.
- A Question answer goes directly to its exact pending Question owner and is not a Steering Intent. An Approval answer or decline goes directly to its exact live tool call owner and is not a Steering Intent. Single-prompt answers follow prompt order and are not retained across restart. A submitted answer payload is immutable; an editable draft after failed delivery affects only a later explicit submission. Supported post-answer actions validate their inputs.
- A successful exact claim of a waiting Approval transfers that immutable action from its caller to the exact execution. If Kent observes caller cancellation before claim, the Approval remains pending without effect. Caller cancellation after claim stops only that caller's wait. Kent continues optional Engine Intent Queue submission or terminal admission-failure handling, tool delivery, decision effects, and prompt finalization for Allow, Deny, and decline.
- An Allow decision with nonblank commentary first submits that commentary as one ordinary Steering Intent to the Engine Intent Queue. Engine Intent Queue acceptance is the process-local commentary commit boundary. After acceptance, Kent directly delivers Allow and waits for the waiting tool to accept the decision and any selected session-wide grant without waiting for the Steering Intent to execute. The Steering Intent applies in ordinary acceptance order at that Agent Step's normal Step Boundary and becomes model-visible before another provider request. This replaces any requirement that commentary become model-visible before the tool receives Allow.
- Allow commentary creates no Queue Item or separate Pending Work item. A retryable request or transport failure observed before exact Approval claim leaves the Approval pending with no commentary effect. After claim, failure to admit commentary because the Engine has closed ends the tool call with a visible error, closes the Approval, and does not restore it to pending. If Kent accepts commentary but cannot deliver Allow to the approved tool, Kent also ends that tool call with a visible error and closes the Approval. Kent adds no guarantee that accepted commentary survives a server restart before durable transcript history.
- Parent execution cancellation, sibling-tool failure, execution cleanup, and retirement retain ordinary execution ordering rather than the Interrupt race guarantee. A claimed Approval has one terminal owner that arbitrates consumer acceptance against execution closure. Closure before consumer acceptance ends the tool call with one visible error and closes the Approval. Consumer acceptance first applies the decision once. Kent publishes the Approval's resolved state once only after either terminal outcome. Any accepted commentary remains single-copy.
- If an accepted Allow-commentary Steering Intent fails during its Step-Boundary application, Kent ends that Agent Step with a visible error before another provider request. Kent does not retry the commentary, restore the Approval, or report the failed message as model-visible.
- Denial commentary travels only with the Approval answer and creates no separate model-visible user message. Patch, edit, and `view_image` denied tool errors use the literal `User also said:` commentary marker. Each tool retains its surrounding error prose, quoting, serialization, typed payload where present, and client presentation.
- When one model response prepares several valid `ask_question` calls, Kent keeps them serial and FIFO. A single-prompt answer remains in flight until a later prepared Question becomes pending or the same Exact Execution Scope closes. Clients keep the accepted Question visible but disabled until authoritative prompt state replaces or removes it.
- A typed prompt-answer batch uses the Step identity as its only batch identity. Each entry uses its Tool Call ID. The batch and its entries have no generated prompt, request, operation, or Approval identity and no replay memo. Each submitted entry is an answered Question, an answered Approval, or a declined prompt.
- Kent validates the complete typed batch before resolving any prompt. A malformed entry rejects the batch without resolving valid siblings.
- The order of submitted batch entries has no meaning. Kent resolves submitted prompts that remain pending for that Step in server prompt order. Ordinary Questions retain model tool-call order. Approval order across tool calls follows server materialization order and has no product guarantee.
- A Question or Approval omitted from the batch remains pending. A live tool call waiting for its sole Approval may accept the first complete submitted action. A live tool call that is no longer waiting for Approval, a finished tool call, and a stale tool call are Skipped without applying commentary. A batch in which every submitted entry is Skipped succeeds without changing runtime state.
- A batch answer never waits for a later prepared Question to become pending and never pre-answers a future prompt. It completes after processing the submitted prompts that remain pending or after an operational failure.
- The first complete action to reach each Question or Approval owner wins. Concurrent losing submissions are Skipped and apply no commentary. If a batch fails after resolving an earlier entry, that resolution remains committed and every unprocessed entry remains pending. Kent does not roll back, continue, replay, automatically retry, or retain a batch result for recovery. After connection loss, clients read the latest completed pending-prompt projection. A later explicit submission for the same Approval uses the same Tool Call ID and may change its immutable payload only while that tool call remains waiting for Approval.
- A successful batch response contains every submitted Tool Call ID exactly once and no other Tool Call ID. Each result is typed Resolved or Skipped. Result order has no meaning.
- A declined ordinary Question produces the same canceled/error Ask Question outcome as terminal cancellation, with no completed answer or synthetic user message. A declined Approval creates no separate decision row.
- Resolved-prompt updates carry Tool Call ID only. They never expose answer or decline content.
- Answered-Question history comes only from the Session event log. Kent does not store a database copy of Question text or answers.
- The Question-history command may read backward through the event log across its requested number of history-replacement windows. This command is an explicit exception to the normal prohibition on full-history transcript reads.
- Question-history reading does not block Session work and provides no consistency guarantee while the event log changes. It may return stale or duplicate Questions.
- A read or decode failure stops Question-history reading. Human output retains Questions already emitted; streaming JSON may remain partial and invalid.
- Question-history delivery reuses the generic subscription transport. The server emits start metadata, zero or more Questions, and final omission metadata in that order; clients consume those typed events without a separate lifecycle-validation state machine. Generic transport completion is operation success, and a transport failure remains an operational failure even after final omission metadata.
- Question-history reading ignores provider-history items carried by history replacements. It reads self-contained Question completion events only.
- Event-log schema v2 stores structured Question answers and their answer commit time.
- Event-log schema v2 limits event-envelope field names, top-level event-payload field names, and tool names to 4,096 UTF-8 bytes. Writing or decoding an oversized discriminator fails visibly. This limit does not apply to Question text, answers, Commentary, provider history, or other payload content.
- Event-log schema v1 Sessions are openable, resumable, and writable. Question history uses their normalized presented Question text and verbatim flattened completion output, and does not infer selected options, Commentary, or answer time.
- Event-log schema v1 discriminator lengths are not constrained by the v2 limit. If bounded Question-history inspection encounters a v1 discriminator that exceeds the v2 limit, the read stops with a visible decode failure instead of silently omitting the record.
- A forked or cloned Session inherits its source Session's event-log schema version.

## Sessions, Location, And Transcript Bounds

- Sessions can stop and resume. The persistence root is configurable and defaults to `~/.kent`; their durable location model is Project, Workspace, then Worktree.
- Except for an active agent rebinding its own Session under the self-agent rule below, moving a Session to a Workspace in another Project is accepted only while its RuntimeActivity is idle or it has no Active Session Runtime. Every other live state rejects the move immediately without waiting for current work.
- An accepted cross-Project move retires an idle Active Session Runtime before moving the Session. Opening the Session in the destination Project creates a fresh learned-Workspace cache.
- Full transcript history can reach dozens of gigabytes. Production must never load the full session log into memory or walk it from start to end, except when forking or cloning through the selected fork point because copying that history is the operation itself, when the Question-history, Session log, or Session search commands perform their explicitly requested backward history reads, or when streaming a complete Session into an archive.
- Session history commands must stream backward with bounded memory. The CLI Commands specification owns their scope, output, progress, and cancellation behavior.
- Other transcript access for active and dormant Sessions is limited to the requested bounded page or recent tail plus live streaming output. Model context retains only the bounded active segment established by compaction, never the full transcript.
- `server_host` and `server_port` explicitly select the daemon address; Kent binds exactly that address and fails startup if it is occupied. Local same-machine optimization is additive and cannot override either explicit setting.
- Session activation and release identify the exact session resource generation. A stale release is a successful no-op and cannot close or detach a replacement generation.
- Clients and servers using incompatible protocol generations refuse the connection; operators must upgrade and restart both before making requests.
- Published custom protocol error codes are stable wire contracts.
- Absent session lineage is `null`; empty or whitespace-only lineage values are invalid. A Session has separate optional previous-session provenance for human navigation and derived sessions, and parent-agent provenance for model-spawned subagent ancestry. Provenance can cross Projects. Derived Sessions retain the source parent-agent ancestry and record the immediate source as previous-session provenance. Generic parent provenance means previous-session provenance, never model-spawned ancestry.
- Interactive startup is workspace-first. An unregistered workspace enters an explicit binding flow. Server browsing opens existing Projects and Workspaces only. Headless startup in an unregistered workspace fails without creating hidden state.
- Rebinding is explicit; Kent never infers it.
- A session selected for an interactive workspace prompts to rebind only when its attached workspace differs from the open workspace. Detached workspace-location records neither trigger nor supply a rebind. Attached location has one authority; a detached location record is not an execution fallback.
- Interactive Sessions are created lazily, at the first trigger that needs model work.
- A Session retains one unsent input draft for recovery. Clients restore the draft verbatim when opening the Session.
- Session listings expose the first-prompt preview when available. Clients decide whether to display it.
- Immediately before a Session's first model request, and after every compaction before subsequent model work, Kent locks or refreshes the model/provider setup, generation parameters, effective tool declarations and enabled tool set, system and developer context, skills, workspace information, current model-facing date/time, and conversation context for the current Session Contract. The main prompt-cache key remains the Kent Session ID throughout.
- Transcript order is immutable for prompt-cache stability. A pre-commit Result Group persistence failure ends the Exact Execution Scope and makes no committed transcript change. Kent does not replay or reconcile a lost Session operation; a later explicit invocation is a new operation. Process death may lose the current Agent Step and process-local pending Steering as defined by the Runtime Steering specification.

## Authentication And Configuration

- Authentication is global to the server and can retain multiple provider credentials. Startup blocks only when the selected provider requires Kent-managed authentication and no such authentication is available. Custom providers are not authenticated by Kent; their 401 errors are surfaced.
- Authentication failures are actionable. The chooser can offer browser OAuth, device-code OAuth, `No auth`, and confirmed environment-key adoption when available. Browser OAuth accepts a local callback or a pasted callback URL or code.
- Choosing `No auth` clears the active authentication method and environment-versus-saved preference without deleting retained provider credentials. It disables environment-key fallback. Kent sends no authentication credentials until the user explicitly selects another method. Fresh, headless, and remote clients must explicitly acknowledge that policy before proceeding without required Kent-managed authentication; a rebound remote client must acknowledge it again before using server startup routes.
- `/login` and `/logout` reopen authentication selection without first clearing credentials. OAuth failure does not fall back to an API key. Refresh is silent unless it fails. Authentication method changes require no active agent execution.
- Settings default to `~/.kent/config.toml` unless the persistence root changes. Unknown keys are errors. Precedence is command-line overrides, environment, settings file, then built-in defaults. If global and workspace settings resolve to the same physical file, Kent applies it once as global settings, disables the workspace layer, and retains diagnostics for both resolved locations.
- After successful authentication, a missing settings file starts setup before session selection. Headless execution refuses to start until onboarding has completed.
- `theme=light` and `theme=dark` select fixed palettes; `theme=auto` or omission detects terminal or system appearance.
- `debug=true` or `KENT_DEBUG=1` enables fail-fast diagnostic behavior for developer errors. Without debug mode, Kent does not crash for developer errors: it recovers when possible or exits with a clear error.
- Thinking levels pass through unchanged. Kent provides recognized choices such as `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` only when the selected model/provider supports them; otherwise it preserves the user value.
- `model_context_window` is model-specific and user-overridable. Reviewer and subagent context windows must be at least `40000`. `context_compaction_threshold_tokens` must be lower than `model_context_window`; invalid values fail configuration validation.
- Each Session activation must resolve its context window, automatic-compaction threshold, and Compaction Mode from the current persisted-Agent-role configuration. These Context-policy facts must not be snapshotted in the Session Contract, rotate prompt-cache lineage, or otherwise invalidate provider caches. A resumed Session must preserve its provider-capability contract across runs.
- When settings do not explicitly select provider capabilities and no Session provider contract is established, Kent resolves the effective provider variant from the server's non-refreshing effective authentication mode. OAuth uses the ChatGPT Codex variant; persisted or environment API-key and other non-OAuth first-party OpenAI use the OpenAI variant. The stateless New Chat settings read, dormant Context, and every Session plan use that same projection. It reads local auth state and environment overrides without refreshing credentials, making a network request, or saving auth state. An auth-method change affects the next read or plan and does not reconfigure an already-live Session runtime; credential refresh remains request-time auth ownership.
- `max_subagent_depth` is a root-level TOML setting with normal global-then-workspace precedence. It defaults to `2`, accepts `0` through `30`, and is checked when a child is launched. `0` disables model-originated child launches; other invalid values fail configuration validation. Values above `30` explain that Kent does not support recursion chains that deep.
- OpenAI Responses `store` is configurable and defaults to `false`.
- `provider_identifier` defaults to `kent`, must be a non-empty HTTP product token, and supplies the OpenAI-family `originator` header and `<provider_identifier>/<Kent version>` user agent for main, reviewer, Workflow, and subagent model requests. It takes effect after restart for resumed Sessions. OAuth bootstrap, subscription status, and update checks do not use it.
- Backend HTTP clients advertise and decode zstd and gzip responses from third-party services. A supported compressed response is decoded even when the request supplied its own `Accept-Encoding` value. Local server-to-client communication does not use HTTP content compression.
- A model-provider request body is compressed only when the selected provider protocol requires a content coding, its uncompressed length is known and at least 1,024 bytes, and the body is replayable. Nil, empty, unknown-length, and non-replayable bodies are not compressed. ChatGPT Codex requests through OpenAI OAuth use zstd level 3. OpenAI API-key, OpenAI-compatible, and Anthropic requests do not use request compression.
- Kent preserves an explicitly supplied `Accept-Encoding` or `Content-Encoding` header and does not stack another content coding. Kent does not retry a rejected request without compression.
- `tools.web_search` defaults to enabled; `web_search` is `native` or `off`. `tools.view_image` defaults to enabled and is advertised only to multimodal-capable models.

## Model Requests And Cache Continuity

- Every model generation request uses the provider's streaming response protocol. Kent has no non-streaming generation or fallback path.
- Callers that expose only a completed response consume the generation stream internally and return the assembled response only after the stream completes successfully.
- One generation-stream contract carries assistant output, reasoning output, provider-hosted output, and stream activity.
- Every generation request has a required tool-choice mode: automatic or required. Missing or unknown modes are invalid.
- Required tool choice validates against the complete advertised tool set, including local, custom, and enabled provider-hosted tools. An empty set is invalid. A provider that cannot represent required choice returns a policy error before dispatch. Automatic and required requests use the same bounded provider- and transport-failure retry policy; a retry preserves the request's tool-choice mode and advertised tools, and Kent never falls back from required to automatic choice.
- Tool-choice mode changes only tool selection. It never changes the advertised tools or their order, parallel-tool behavior, or prompt-cache identity. Exact counting of a built request preserves its tool mode and complete tool set; standalone estimation uses automatic choice.
- On supported models and request modes, existing human and Workflow Thinking controls must use native configuration updates while keeping the original request-level reasoning effort unchanged.
- Kent must retain dispatched configuration updates in their original conversation positions without creating an ordinary visible Chat message.
- Changes made before dispatch must use the final effective Thinking value without producing adjacent configuration updates.
- Compaction must re-establish the effective Thinking effort for subsequent generation through the supported configuration-update protocol.
- An existing Session must initialize its fixed reasoning baseline from its current effective Thinking level when it first uses configuration updates. This initialization may cause a cache miss and must not reconstruct or rewrite earlier requests.
- Unsupported models and request modes must retain ordinary Thinking behavior.

## Fast Mode And Context Usage

- Fast Mode is a persisted Session Chat setting when the active provider supports first-party Responses priority service.
- Changing Fast Mode during an Agent Step persists and publishes immediately, affects the next provider or compaction request, and never changes the request already running.
- A Fast Mode change creates no transcript row.
- A supported request uses the provider's priority service tier when Fast Mode is enabled.
- Disabled Fast Mode omits the provider's priority service tier.
- Enabling Fast Mode for an unsupported provider fails without changing the Session setting.
- Reopening a Session restores its effective Fast Mode setting.
- Fast Mode does not create another Session Contract generation or prompt-cache identity.
- Reviewer and compaction requests inherit the Session's effective Fast Mode when their provider supports it.
- Context usage uses current provider-reported usage when available and Kent's established current-context estimate otherwise.
- Compaction selection compares current usage with the configured thresholds.
- Kent does not predict future token growth from earlier turns or maintain a separate adaptive compaction policy.

## Compaction

- Compaction starts a new bounded active conversation from compacted output while retaining the full durable session history. The compacted output and all new generation context are committed atomically before later model work.
- `compaction_mode=dynamic` must be the default when configuration does not explicitly select a mode. Explicit `local`, `native`, and `none` selections must retain their behavior.
- Dynamic compaction must ask the model which carryover-summary sections are relevant, assemble the handoff prompt from the selected section templates, and generate the resulting sectioned carryover.
- Dynamic sections must be sections of the handoff summary, not separate persistent note files.
- Dynamic compaction must use the existing compaction and handoff lifecycle. Selecting this mode must not change compaction trigger timing or add a separate context-reset tool.
- Dynamic compaction must start the fresh active context with its carryover and guidance explaining the handoff and the Session history commands for recovering older information.
- Dynamic compaction must not rewrite or roll back already-sent section-selection history.
- Fresh main hydration, Reviewer request construction, and post-compaction hydration share one canonical stable prefix: applicable Headless context, Subagents, Skills, Worktree context, Agents.md instructions, then active Goal continuation or Workflow context.
- Fresh main and Reviewer requests append Environment after that stable prefix.
- Post-compaction hydration inserts compacted or handoff output and manual user carryover before the same Environment suffix, except for the provider-native continuation ordering below.
- Successful provider-native compaction must place its continuation reminder as the first ordinary developer message after the system prompt, before other developer context, the unchanged encrypted checkpoint, and Environment. The reminder must belong to the same committed replacement and use the ordinary developer-notice contract. Local compaction uses its summary wrapper without that native reminder.
- Compaction continuation guidance preserves the original user objective, subsequent corrections, decisions, constraints, and remaining work, and directs reuse of completed work and verification unless new evidence makes them stale.
- A single editable Markdown document must own compaction continuation guidance. Native compaction inserts that guidance directly; the local handoff-summary wrapper includes it through a template.
- Handoff output includes the user-authored future-agent message in the atomic history replacement.
- Goal and Workflow remain alternative Session-mode context in their respective slots.
- Outside Workflow execution, Kent includes an active Goal continuation only for an active Goal.
- Paused, completed, cleared, or absent Goals omit Goal continuation from model context.
- Opening or resuming a Session without replacement does not add Goal continuation.
- A resumed non-Workflow Session carries its active Goal verbatim into new model context with the ordinary Goal work and completion guidance, without referring to compaction.
- If a later notification fails, compaction remains complete, Kent reports the failure, and does not repeat compaction.
- Kent may compact before a queued user prompt when configured context usage indicates that prompt would likely require it. The trigger is `context_compaction_threshold_tokens - pre_submit_compaction_lead_tokens`. Normal and pre-submit compaction thresholds must be at least 50% of `model_context_window`; invalid settings fail startup.
- When automatic compaction is enabled, Kent eagerly compacts an eligible non-Workflow Session after any successfully completed agent/model turn with a nonblank final answer when authoritative context usage is at least 88% of that Session's actual model context window. Eligible paths include direct and queued user-message turns, Agent Steer turns, Goal Loops, and background continuations. Workflow turns are excluded. Main and subagent Sessions are eligible in both interactive and Headless modes. Interrupted turns, failed turns, turns waiting for a user answer, and no-final or silent-final outcomes are ineligible.
- Before automatic compaction starts, Kent revalidates the Session's current automatic-compaction enablement and consumed-only 88% threshold.
- If either automatic-compaction condition no longer holds, Kent skips compaction without a provider call or history replacement.
- A user message submitted while eager compaction is running waits behind that compaction and is then processed against the compacted context.
- Eager compaction is speculative. Its failure does not change the preceding successful turn, retains the uncompacted context, uses the ordinary diagnostic reporting, and is not retried automatically.
- `compaction_mode=none` disables manual and automatic compaction and lets provider context-overflow errors surface.
- A manual compact request is a typed Pending Work item and follows the Session's accepted mutation order.
- Compaction is an Agent Step selected after earlier accepted short mutations apply according to the Runtime Steering specification.
- A manual compact request is never model-visible user text.
- Manual-compaction policy and eligibility are revalidated when the pending request starts.
- Manual compaction has canonical presentation `/compact` followed by normalized guidance when present.
- Repeated manual compact requests remain distinct.
- Clients do not coalesce manual compact requests.
- Each manual compact request receives its own typed outcome.
- Agent Steps do not overlap, so manual, automatic, pre-submit, and handoff compaction cannot overlap another compaction Agent Step.
- Manual compaction requires at least one Agent Step boundary since Session creation or the latest successful compaction. The active Agent Step satisfies this requirement when its boundary is reached. A rejected request starts no provider call and commits no history replacement.
- Disabled-policy and too-soon manual-compaction failures are typed server-owned outcomes shared by every client.
- Human-facing text calls this operation `compact`; model-facing context calls it `handoff`. Manual compaction carries the last visible user prompt. Agent handoff may carry a future-agent message visible only in detail.
- The main-agent prompt-cache key is always the Kent Session ID. Compaction and Session Contract changes add no cache-key suffix, namespace, or generation. Reviewer requests remain under the Session's reviewer key.
- Every production model dispatch must record the exact dispatched cache lineage before sending and the provider-reported cache reuse after a successful response. Generation, Reviewer, local compaction, and provider-native compaction provide no unobserved dispatch path.
- Native and local compaction requests must preserve the maximal unchanged prefix of the preceding model request. Provider-native compaction uses the ordinary Session Contract, system prompt, tools, and active history before its compaction trigger. Repeated local compaction retains the complete current active history, including the prior compaction replacement.
- The compaction request uses the pre-compaction locked contract. After compaction completes, the next model request refreshes and locks effective model/provider settings, enabled tools, and system/reviewer prompts. Changed prompt-facing content naturally invalidates the changed request prefix while the prompt-cache key remains the Session ID.
- Compaction alone emits no cache warning. `cache_warning_mode=default` records confirmed non-postfix invalidation and observed cache-reuse disappearance in Detail. `verbose` exposes the same warnings in Ongoing. `off` disables cache warnings.
- Local compaction permits no tool calls. Each attempt that receives one records a model-visible and user-visible instruction not to call tools and to retry; Kent retries up to three times, then fails compaction and stops the model loop. Local summaries use automatic tool choice; post-compaction Workflow work uses the Node's ordinary generation policy.
- If compaction both exceeds provider context length and receives the corresponding provider error, Kent retries the compaction request with cumulative supported earlier tool-payload collapse targets of 10%, 20%, and 40% of the model context window. Shell output and patch input become exactly `<collapsed>`; calls and their output relationships remain, while reasoning and unsupported payloads remain unchanged. A successful repair records the collapse count and estimated omitted tokens for the operator.
- Completing compaction alone adds no UI-only transcript entry; transcript-visible summaries are ordinary transcript content.
- Persisting the Context read's completed-compaction count or manual-Compact eligibility is best-effort. A failed metadata write does not fail an otherwise successful compaction or Agent Step; Kent reports the failure through its operational diagnostics and adds no retry or recovery flow for these facts.

## Goals

- Goal inspection reads the durable session goal and does not require an Active Session Runtime. Running and dormant sessions return the same goal result; a valid session with no goal returns no goal, while unknown or inaccessible sessions remain errors.
- Goal inspection excludes runtime-local goal-loop suspension. Live clients derive suspension from runtime status.
- Successful goal mutations through an Active Session Runtime emit typed goal-status updates carrying the projected goal status state so frontends can update from goal SSOT instead of inferring status from transcript feedback or run lifecycle. Set, pause, resume, complete, and clear emit updates; show/read-only operations do not. A dormant mutation has no live feed: its command response and subsequent session/runtime snapshots project the durable goal state.
- `/goal <objective>` (TUI slash command or GUI path) submits a typed Session mutation that sets or replaces the Session Goal.
- Goal behavior owns whether a Goal mutation starts or continues model work.
- `/goal resume` on a completed goal reopens it as active.
- `/goal resume` on an already-active goal is no-op and does not emit any model-facing messages.
- Goal mode requires `ask_question` in the locked tool surface for active model loops. Validate parity at model-work startup and surface a normal runtime error if violated. This parity is enforced inside workflow-controlled Sessions too, so a Goal set there requires `ask_question` visibility as well.
- Lock: `ask_question` visibility and `/questions` state are separate contracts. Missing `ask_question` from the locked tool surface blocks goal model loops; `/questions off` only makes `ask_question` calls return the questions-disabled tool result and must not stop, suspend, or block active goal execution.
- During live Workflow exact execution, user and agent Goal mutations follow the ordinary Goal rules while Goal continuation remains passive.
- A retained Workflow control-only Runtime accepts a user Goal mutation only when it is a no-op, does not require starting new ordinary Goal execution, or is already owned by the current Exact Execution Scope.
- A retained Workflow control-only Runtime rejects a user Goal mutation that requires starting new ordinary Goal execution before Steering acceptance through ordinary Goal mutation error feedback.
- While an Exact Execution Scope drives the Session for Workflow Execution, the Goal is a passive objective: no separate Goal Continuation Loop operates, and the active Goal's reminder is folded into the Workflow's invalid-completion nudge.
- Outside workflow-controlled execution, active-Goal continuation after history replacement is a Markdown-backed developer initialization message. It begins `Heads up: this session has an active goal. Goal text:`, inserts the exact Goal verbatim between the ordinary nudge's `<goal>` markers, says `Continue working towards the goal from the resumed state.`, and then reuses the ordinary Goal nudge's shared `Work mode` and `Completion discipline` guidance. Agent-facing continuation text never mentions compaction.
- A valid terminal workflow completion soft-cascades an active goal to complete (actor=system) in the same step, across structured-output, unstructured-output, tool, and shell-command completion intents. A valid completion is never blocked by a still-active goal; paused goals are left intact. The cascade is conditional on the same goal still being active when it commits, and for tool-mode completion it is emitted after the terminal tool result is persisted so it never interleaves a non-tool item between a tool call and its result.
- That terminal cascade must observe only the Goal already durable when completion commits. A Goal mutation must persist during its admission, including within the same Agent Step.
- A same-Step Goal mutation that leaves an active Goal after terminal Workflow completion does not start Goal continuation from that completion boundary. The Goal remains active and idle until later explicit human input starts ordinary work.
- With an Active Session Runtime, Goal mutations must persist immediately and atomically in Goal admission order. Their model-facing notices must enter the Engine Intent Queue in the same order and wait for the next Step Boundary.
- Without an Active Session Runtime, the dormant Goal owner persists the durable Goal update and corresponding model-facing notice without starting a Runtime.
- Goal mutation requests from every client must return the persisted Goal result without waiting for a Step Boundary or model-visible reminder delivery. An allowed agent `goal set` or confirmed `goal complete` must validate the current Exact Execution Scope, Run, and Agent Step and persist the mutation within that admission.
- If the originating Agent Step ends first, the agent Goal mutation must reject without changing the Goal. If admission completes first, it must return the committed Goal, including its identity and timestamps. Terminal Workflow completion earlier in that still-open Step does not by itself reject or revoke the Goal admission.
- After terminal Workflow completion commits, exact Goal admission remains available only for that same still-open Scope, Run, and Agent Step. Stop, prompt answers, exact steer, and duplicate Workflow completion remain unavailable while caused tool/results finish.
- Goal validation must use the durable Goal, including every earlier committed Goal mutation, rather than a scheduled projection.
- A stale agent execution must reject before persistence. A later notice-delivery failure must appear as Runtime/model-visible failure feedback; Kent must not undo the committed Goal, rewrite the completed shell result, or replay the mutation.
- An effective set/replace, pause, resume/reopen, complete, or clear mutation persists one model-facing goal notice in both live and dormant sessions. A no-op mutation persists no notice.
- On the dormant path, the durable goal update is authoritative and is persisted before its model-facing notice. If the later notice persistence fails, the goal update remains committed and the error is surfaced; no cross-resource rollback, automatic repair, or retry is required.
- Each Goal mutation invocation is a new operation. A repeated invocation follows the current Goal state and the ordinary validation and no-op rules; Kent does not replay an earlier response or error.
- Goal CLI never mutates Session storage directly. It submits the Goal operation to the server, which selects the live Steering path or dormant Store path.
- Any `kent service` commands that affect the server state (restart, stop, start it) detect invocation by kent itself and refuse to run, being human-only.
- Ctrl+C during active goal work keeps persisted status `active` and creates runtime-local suspension only. The next user message auto-resumes the suspended goal loop after its turn completes (no `/goal resume` needed); an explicit `/goal pause` is still the hard pause. A user turn that is itself interrupted leaves the loop suspended.
- The goal status-line indicator in TUI shows the animated spinner only while a goal run is executing; when the goal is `active` but idle (e.g. after Ctrl+C), it shows the idle status dot.

## Reviewer

- Post-turn Reviewer exists behind config and defaults to `reviewer.frequency = "edits"`.
- Reviewer runs only after an eligible completed assistant answer.
- Kent captures Reviewer input from that answer boundary before later Session changes can alter it.
- The main answer commits and becomes visible without waiting for Reviewer.
- User input and ordinary main-model and tool work may continue while Reviewer runs.
- Only one Reviewer request may be active for a Session.
- Another eligible answer is skipped rather than queued while review is active.
- The Reviewer receives shorter tool output than the main agent and returns minimal JSON `{"suggestions":["..."]}`.
- Invalid Reviewer payloads are ignored non-fatally.
- A Reviewer generation failure creates one later Reviewer error row when the Runtime can still receive it.
- Reviewer phase changes and completion create no transcript row.
- Nonempty suggestions create one later Reviewer feedback row and request one ordinary main-agent follow-up at the next available model boundary.
- A follow-up that returns a nonblank final answer reports the suggestions as applied.
- An explicitly blank silent follow-up reports that no changes were applied.
- `reviewer.verbose_output` controls only the TUI's initial feedback presentation.
- `reviewer.verbose_output` never controls whether feedback exists.
- If Kent cannot apply issued nonempty feedback, the feedback remains visible and the Session follows its ordinary Runtime failure behavior.
- Reviewer runs once and does not review its own follow-up.
- Live Reviewer activity follows the phase contract in the Runtime Steering specification.
- Live Reviewer activity is not persisted or reconstructed from transcript history.
- Persistent Reviewer activity across later lifecycle boundaries, Runtime replacement, reconnect, or restart is outside this specification.

## Headless Mode And Shared Control

- Model-originated delegation is limited by parent-agent ancestry. A root is depth `0`; with the default limit `2`, root to subagent to sub-subagent is permitted and the next launch is rejected before creating a Session. The limit applies across roles and Workflow-agent delegation; Workflow Node Sessions start at depth `0`. Opening or continuing a Session is not a child launch.
- Ancestry checks inspect at most 30 parent-agent links. Missing older lineage means root; permission, I/O, corruption, or unavailable storage rejects the launch. Repeated lineage is rejected in production and fails fast with diagnostics in debug mode. A stale or missing immediate caller Session is invalid caller context and reports guidance to use a live Kent shell.
- A blocked launch returns attempted depth and configured limit.
- The role catalog remains visible regardless of depth policy. A role with `agent_callable=false` is hidden from model role context and cannot be launched as a Kent-session subagent, but humans can use it headlessly and Workflows can assign it. `fast` remains outside the custom-role catalog, bypasses Workflow-specific role controls, can use a faster first-party provider profile or user configuration, and obeys `agent_callable`.
- `[workflow] subagents` is TOML-only and defaults to `false`. Workflow-agent use of custom roles requires `agent_callable=true`, `[workflow] subagents = true`, and effective `workflow_subagent=true`. `workflow_subagent=false` excludes a role only from Workflow-agent delegation, not human headless use or direct Workflow-node assignment.
- A live internal access Approval, including an outside-workspace patch request, is an access-request Question for `kent question` and wait/watch presentation. Each authoritative ordered option carries its display label and typed allow-once, allow-session, or deny decision. A durable Workflow Transition Approval is a separate concept and is never a Question or wait/watch outcome.
- The [CLI Commands](cli-commands.md) specification owns the Question and Run wait/watch command contracts, including presentation, accepted flags, machine-readable output, and exit codes.
- All attached clients have equal full control of one active Session across transcript and status, steering and queued input, Question and Approval answers, and every other control.
- Valid human input remains accepted while internal Runtime work is active and follows the Runtime Steering ordering contract.
- Clients report server-authoritative live activity and do not infer busy state locally.
- A client does not consider a question or approval answered until the server accepts the answer and returns or publishes the resolved shared state.
- A running Workflow Task is steerable from every attached client, including chat, queued input, Goal control, settings, compaction, worktree, and process controls. The model may not submit a structured final answer invalid for the current Node. Inability to reach active execution is a runtime-unavailable error.
- Worktree controls are available from every client. List and status are reads. Creation and deletion that do not switch the calling Session execute immediately.
- Entering or leaving a Worktree for an Active Session Runtime accepts one typed Pending Work item carrying the domain Worktree Operation identity.
- Acceptance returns the established acknowledgement without waiting for the next Step Boundary or transition completion.
- Entering or leaving a Worktree for a dormant Session remains a direct Worktree operation.
- The Worktree owner later applies the target, Working Directory, tool environment, and reminder or failure.
- Each explicit Worktree transition is an independent domain operation. Kent does not return an earlier result for a matching retry, reject a different transition merely because another is pending, replay an ambiguous operation, or resume process-local pending transitions after restart.
- Worktree deletion follows the concrete multi-Session and process blockers in the Runtime Steering and Workflow specifications.
- Worktree deletion never joins Session mutation ordering.
- When the active agent invokes rebind for its own Session, Kent accepts the move only for that Exact Execution Scope and applies it at the next between-Agent-Step boundary before queued user work. A required cross-Project Runtime retirement fails queued input owned by that retiring Runtime with `runtime_unavailable`; Kent does not transfer it to the fresh destination Runtime.
- Human and startup rebinds remain synchronous.
- A self-agent rebind ignores Session-owned background commands. Existing commands continue in the directories where they started, and commands started after the move use the new Working Directory.
- A Session rebind sets the Working Directory to the target Workspace root.
- A Session rebind either applies its Project, Workspace, artifact location, Working Directory, and successful reminder together or leaves the previous location unchanged.
- A successful self-agent rebind or its authoritative failure notice is included in the next naturally occurring model step. Rebind does not start a model step.
- Resuming a Session reapplies its recorded subagent role, including a role that is no longer available in the catalog. If no role was recorded, explicit continuation does not block. After the Session Contract is locked, a later role selection does not replace the retained role.

## Provider Stream Completion

- OpenAI-compatible Responses streams accept `data: [DONE]` or EOF after a valid `response.completed` event. `response.failed`, `response.incomplete`, `error`, and caller cancellation are failures. EOF before a valid terminal event, including malformed framing that prevents reading one, is a provider-contract error and never a partial completion.
