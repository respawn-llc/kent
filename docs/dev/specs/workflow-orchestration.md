# Workflow Orchestration Spec

## Purpose And Scope

- Workflow orchestration lets users define reusable, Project-scoped processes for Tasks.
- A Workflow contains Nodes and Transitions.
- Tasks can move through agent work, scripts, review loops, parallel branches, Joins, and terminal states.
- Every Kent client presents the same server-owned Workflow and Task behavior.
- Data-only Workflow and Task requests independently load the latest completed durable and live projections available to them. Responses may be stale or combine facts from different completed moments, while mutations revalidate their safety-critical facts.
- Every incompatible Workflow contract change increments the client/server protocol version. Incompatible clients fail with a clear compatibility error, and Kent does not emulate another Workflow contract version.

## Domain Model

- `Task` is the primary durable work item. Sessions are retained artifacts associated with agent Nodes on the Task.
- A Task directly owns its Current Nodes. It usually has one and may have several only while a fan-out executes parallel branches.
- Current Nodes have no independent entity IDs. Parallel state uses the Transition Branch Keys needed by the fan-out and Join.
- An executable current Node owns only its current execution state and optional Session binding. Script Nodes have no Session.
- Leaving a Node removes that current execution state. Kent does not retain completed Node execution, execution-attempt, or workflow-movement records as hidden history.
- Task creation creates a durable Task at the Workflow's Start Node.
- Automation starts only through explicit Task Start, which applies the Start Node's outgoing Transition and adds the first executable current Node.
- Automation continues through automatic Nodes until terminal or blocked by a Question, Approval/manual gate, error, capacity, interruption, or validation.
- Task status combines Current Nodes with current live activity. Kent does not store a second lifecycle status that can disagree with them.
- Running and waiting require matching Exact Execution Scope evidence. Queued status requires either a queued Exact Execution Scope or Workflow Execution's live automatic-concurrency queue ownership. A current Terminal Node makes the Task done.
- A Project owns one shared Label catalog for every linked Workflow board. Tasks can use only Labels from their Project.
- Labels are many-to-many organizational metadata on tasks. They never affect workflow state, scheduling, prompts, task status, or execution.

## Task Mutation Authority

- Users may Start, Interrupt, Resume, approve, or manually move any otherwise
  eligible Task.
- A Session associated with a Task may Start, Interrupt, Resume, approve, or
  manually move a different Task.
- A Session associated with a Task must not Start, Interrupt, Resume, approve,
  or manually move its own Task.
- Kent derives the invoking Session's Task from the Session's direct durable
  Task ownership.
- The server trusts the optional invoking-Session identity supplied by the
  client. A request that omits it is treated as user-originated.
- This restriction is a cooperative agent policy, not an authentication
  boundary against a modified client or direct RPC caller.
- The restriction does not depend on the invoking Session's Current Node or
  live execution state.
- A persisted Session with no Task ownership may Start, Interrupt, Resume,
  approve, or manually move any otherwise eligible Task.
- If the supplied invoking Session does not exist, Kent rejects the operation
  and changes nothing.
- A self-target rejection changes no Task, Approval, execution-target, live
  execution, or scheduling state.

## Task Labels And Filtering

- Each label has an immutable UUID v4 identity. Its mutable name is trimmed, 1–64 characters, preserves display capitalization, and permits Unicode letters and numbers, spaces, and `: & * % $ # @ ! ? . , / \ + | - _ ~ '`.
- Label names are case-insensitively unique within a Project. Capitalization-only rename is allowed without changing identity or task assignments.
- A Project can have at most 100 Labels. Clients load the complete catalog without pagination.
- A task may use any subset of its Project's catalog; there is no separate per-task label limit.
- Label creation, rename, deletion, assignment, and removal remain available regardless of whether affected Tasks are Backlog, active, running, interrupted, or done.
- Label changes do not change a Task's update time. Outside Labels sorting, they do not change Task order between board page requests. While a Workflow board sorts by Labels, assignment, deletion, or Project Label reorder can reposition Tasks relative to subsequent offset requests.
- Task creation may atomically assign existing Project labels. Later assignment changes use idempotent add/remove semantics: adding an existing assignment or removing an absent assignment succeeds and returns the authoritative resulting label set.
- Renaming takes effect everywhere without changing assignments. Deletion requires confirmation and atomically removes the label from every task; the confirmation does not require an affected-task count. Desktop deletion uses explicit confirmation.
- Labels have no color. A Project owns one durable manual Label sequence.
- Creating a Label places it at the beginning of the sequence. Renaming a Label preserves its position. Deleting a Label preserves the relative order of every surviving Label.
- Every Label catalog and assigned-Label projection uses the Project sequence. The catalog sequence is authoritative; clients do not receive a separate position value.
- A reorder applies to one Project and must identify every current Label in that Project exactly once. Kent rejects missing, duplicate, unknown, and cross-Project Label identities without changing the sequence.
- Reordering to the current sequence succeeds without a durable change or Project event. Changing the sequence persists atomically and emits one Project event.
- Kent does not guarantee the relative outcome of concurrent reorder requests.
- Concurrent Label catalog mutations may fail. A failed mutation leaves the catalog unchanged, and Kent does not retry it automatically.
- The Desktop board filter chooser is the Label reorder surface.
- Kent does not promise the initial relative sequence of Labels that predate manual ordering.
- Task-list `labels` sorting remains available when explicitly requested.
- Kent applies Label filters before pagination for Workflow boards and Task lists.
- An included Label condition is true when a Task has that Label. An excluded Label condition is true when a Task does not have that Label.
- OR matches a Task when at least one included or excluded Label condition is true. AND matches a Task when every included and excluded Label condition is true. A named filter may consist entirely of excluded Label conditions. One condition behaves identically in both modes.
- `No labels` matches Tasks with zero Label assignments and is mutually exclusive with named Label conditions. No named Label conditions means no Label restriction.
- Kent combines the complete Label expression with every other active Task-list filter. Filtering preserves sorting and pagination behavior. A client never loads the complete board or Task list to apply filters.

## Workflow Board Ordering

- A Workflow board applies one selected order independently inside every column.
- Board sorting offers `Updated`, `Created`, `Labels`, and `Short ID`, in that order.
- The default board order is `Updated Desc`.
- `Created Asc` and `Updated Asc` show the oldest Tasks first. Their descending orders show the newest Tasks first.
- `Short ID Asc` shows the lowest Task Short ID first. `Short ID Desc` shows the highest Task Short ID first.
- Labels sorting arranges each Task's complete assigned Label sequence in the Project's manual Label order and compares the sequences from left to right.
- In ascending Labels order, the first differing Label decides the order, and a shorter otherwise-identical sequence comes first.
- Descending Labels order reverses the comparison among labeled Tasks.
- Tasks with no Labels follow every labeled Task in both Labels directions.
- When Tasks have equal values for any selected field, including equal Label sequences, Kent must use Task Short ID as the final tie-breaker in the selected direction.
- Kent combines every active board filter with logical AND and applies the complete filter before sorting and pagination.
- The Kent server owns board ordering and pagination. Clients preserve the returned order and do not sort board cards.
- Each returned board page is bounded. Clients never load a complete board or column to sort it.
- Done has no Task-count bound. Board sorting may evaluate all matching Tasks before applying an offset, so Kent makes no board-sort latency guarantee for very large matching columns.
- Board pagination uses a zero-based offset. Changing the complete filter or selected sort restarts pagination at offset zero.
- A Task or Project Label mutation can change filtered-set membership for any board sort when a Label filter is active; outside `Labels` sorting it preserves the relative order of Tasks that remain members. Desktop invalidates and refetches active board cards after a committed local or subscribed Label mutation, preserving the retained offsets while adopting the current server order. A Task or Project Label order change between page requests may therefore transiently repeat or skip a Task in the loaded view, and Kent does not guarantee a stable snapshot across page requests.

## Task Dependencies

- A Task Dependency is one directed relationship from a Blocker Task to a
  Blocked Task.
- The ordered Blocker Task and Blocked Task identities identify the
  relationship. A Task Dependency has no separate product identifier.
- Both Tasks in a Task Dependency must belong to the same Project. They may
  belong to different linked Workflows or source workspaces in that Project.
- Kent stores one relationship direction. It derives `Blocked by` and `Blocks`
  views and never stores a reverse copy.
- A Task may have at most 50 direct Blocker Tasks.
- A Task may directly block at most 50 Tasks.
- Kent returns each complete direct relationship direction without pagination.
- A Task cannot depend on itself.
- Kent rejects a relationship when the reverse direct relationship already
  exists.
- Kent permits directed dependency cycles of three or more Tasks.
- Kent never traverses transitive dependencies for attachment, display, start
  confirmation, or agent context.
- Task Dependencies are advisory planning metadata. They never pause, move,
  resume, interrupt, or otherwise mutate work already underway.
- Users may add or remove Task Dependencies in every Task state.
- Adding an existing relationship succeeds without changing state.
- Removing an absent relationship succeeds without changing state.
- An actual relationship addition or removal changes the update time of both
  affected Tasks.
- An idempotent no-op does not change either Task's update time.
- A change in dependency satisfaction updates authoritative dependency
  projections without changing the Blocked Task's update time.
- Kent validates Task existence, Project scope, self-dependency, reciprocal
  dependency, and both cardinality limits before it adds a relationship.
- Kent validates and applies one relationship mutation atomically.
- A relationship validation failure changes neither Task nor relationship
  state.
- Task creation may request multiple incoming and outgoing Task Dependencies.
- Kent validates Task creation and every requested Task Dependency as one operation, then atomically creates the Task and all requested relationships.
- A validation failure during Task creation creates neither the Task nor any requested relationship.
- Concurrent relationship additions cannot exceed either cardinality limit.
- Typed relationship errors identify the violated rule and the affected Tasks.
- A Task Dependency is satisfied if and only if its Blocker Task has
  authoritative `done` status.
- The shared Workflow-board and Task-list dependency filter is nullable. `null` applies no dependency restriction. `true` includes Tasks with zero unsatisfied direct Task Dependencies. `false` includes Tasks with one or more unsatisfied direct Task Dependencies.
- A Task with no direct Task Dependencies matches the `true` dependency filter.
- Kent combines the dependency filter with every other active filter using AND semantics.
- Kent applies the dependency filter before pagination for Workflow boards and Task lists. Clients never load a complete board or Task list to apply it.
- Every Terminal Node satisfies a Task Dependency, including a Terminal Node
  reached through Manual Move.
- Reopening a done Blocker Task makes its Task Dependencies unsatisfied again.
- Task title changes and Project Key changes preserve Task Dependencies and
  immediately change their displayed Task metadata.
- Task Delete atomically removes every incoming and outgoing Task Dependency.
- Deleting a Workflow or Project removes every Task Dependency that touches a
  deleted Task.
- Deletion-induced relationship removal changes each surviving related Task's
  update time once.
- Task Delete confirmation does not add dependency-specific copy or another
  confirmation step.
- `Blocked by` and `Blocks` lists put Tasks whose status is not `done` first,
  then order each group by Task Short ID.
- Task detail exposes both complete directions, canonical related-Task status,
  Blocker satisfaction, and direct aggregate counts from one authoritative
  server projection.
- Task Start and Manual Move to an executable Node check the Blocked
  Task's current direct unsatisfied dependencies.
- Kent performs the dependency check after it validates that the requested
  action is otherwise available and before Execution Target selection or
  another continuation dialog.
- When unsatisfied dependencies exist and the request has no explicit proceed
  intent, Kent returns a typed dependency-confirmation-required outcome with the
  unsatisfied count and changes nothing.
- Proceeding despite dependencies acknowledges one initiating operation. Kent
  does not retain that acknowledgement on the Task.
- Proceeding despite dependencies does not acknowledge a relationship snapshot.
  A concurrent dependency change does not require another confirmation within
  that same initiating operation.
- If a later continuation is dismissed, Kent leaves the Task unchanged and
  discards the proceed intent.
- A later independent Start or Manual Move checks dependencies again.
- Resume, Approval, and automatic Workflow transitions do not request
  dependency acknowledgement.
- Dependencies never become a scheduler gate. An explicitly acknowledged Start
  or Manual Move remains allowed.

## Workflow Definitions

- Workflow definitions are globally reusable and linked to projects. Projects do not copy graph definitions.
- Workflow validation uses Project context because available subagent roles and workspace configuration can differ by Project.
- The CLI emits and applies complete graph editing JSON bound to one Workflow and Workflow Version.
- Graph editing JSON contains Workflow identity, expected Workflow Version, and the authored graph.
- Product surfaces and the CLI can create and edit Workflow definitions.
- Workflow definitions may be saved, linked, and made project default while semantic validation fails.
- A saved Workflow Draft must have valid identifiers, valid references, supported values, unique keys, and exactly one Start Node.
- Users can create Backlog Tasks for an invalid linked or default Workflow while they fix it.
- Task Start, Resume, and automatic scheduling of executable work validate the Workflow in Project context and report all safe, actionable issues. The `ask_question` rule for an Assignee is checked when executable work starts.
- A project can link multiple workflows and has one default workflow for task creation.
- Invalid default workflows are allowed. Task creation against an invalid default creates Backlog tasks, while starting/running those tasks fails with accumulated validation errors until the workflow is fixed.
- Every workflow has exactly one execution target policy: no managed worktree, source `HEAD`, repository default branch, custom Git ref, or operator selection when execution first begins.
- New Workflows default to `ask_on_first_execution`.
- A Workflow that predates Execution Target Policy uses source `HEAD` to preserve its established behavior.
- Custom-ref policy accepts one Git revision. Other policies clear and ignore that value.
- A draft may save custom-ref policy without a value and reports a semantic validation issue. Saving validates presence only; Git resolution is authoritative against the task's source workspace when execution first begins.
- Workflow creation auto-creates ordinary editable `backlog` and `done` nodes.
- Each changed save increments the Workflow Version once. A save that changes both details and graph structure also increments it once. A save that changes nothing does not increment it.
- Pending Approvals retain the Workflow Version and branch snapshots the operator is approving.
- Executable Current Nodes resolve the latest Workflow definition and Runtime Parameter Contract when they start or resume. Completed execution contracts are not retained as history.
- Script Nodes use the current script path and completion requirements each time they execute.

## Nodes, Transitions, And Validation

- Nodes define Workflow states and executable behavior. Agent Nodes configure a required fallback Assignee, completion mode, and worktree and Session policy. Script Nodes configure an executable path.
- Transitions define target Nodes, optional effective-Assignee and thinking selection, Approval, Context-Preservation Mode, Context Source, Parameters, routing, and Join behavior.
- The Assignee is the subagent role materialized for an Agent Current Node. There is no separate product Assignment entity.
- Workflow definitions select configured subagent role identities. They do not directly override model, provider, authentication, or tools. The sole tool exception is the Transition-selected Assignee path, where Kent force-enables Questions; every other tool follows the selected role or retained Session contract.
- Agent Nodes do not own invocation prompts. Each incoming Transition Branch owns its Transition Prompt. Kent provides no Node-level prompt fallback.
- Every Agent Node's configured fallback Assignee, including default and built-in roles, must have `ask_question` enabled. A Transition-selected Assignee is exempt because Kent force-enables Questions only for that execution path. Validation reports affected fallback Nodes and does not change role configuration. Workflow Drafts and Backlog Tasks remain allowed. Task Start, Resume, and manual movement to an executable target validate the latest Workflow before target selection, Task movement, or execution. Pending Approval creation validates before freezing its target; Approval does not repeat that graph or configuration validation.
- Every Agent Node has a required configured Assignee.
- Each eligible incoming serial Transition Branch independently may override that fallback by selecting the effective Assignee through a protected required Transition Parameter.
- An eligible Transition without the override uses the target Agent Node's configured Assignee, so separate incoming Transitions may mix override-enabled and fallback-only behavior.
- Separate serial Transitions that converge on one Agent Node retain independent selector state, protected Parameter configuration, and selected values.
- Fan-Out Transitions cannot select target Assignees or thinking levels.
- Assignee and thinking selection is eligible only from Agent and Script Nodes into Agent Nodes.
- New Session and Compact and Continue Session entries expose and honor enabled Assignee selection.
- Continue Session exposes and honors Assignee selection only when **Previous session from this target, or new session** resolves to a new Session.
- A Continue Session entry that reuses a retained Session hides and ignores a supplied Assignee and preserves the retained Session's materialized Assignee.
- Other Continue Session Context Sources do not expose Assignee selection.
- Every eligible serial Transition may expose and honor enabled thinking selection regardless of Context-Preservation Mode or retained-Session reuse.
- Transition-selected Assignees must be nonblank roles explicitly configured with `agent_callable = true`.
- `workflow_subagent` does not restrict Transition-selected Assignees.
- Unknown roles, roles without explicit `agent_callable = true`, and unavailable roles use one model-facing unavailable-role error category.
- Workflow execution force-enables Questions for a Transition-selected Assignee even when that role's configuration disables Questions.
- When no role is explicitly configured with `agent_callable = true`, Assignee selection is unavailable.
- When exactly one role is explicitly configured with `agent_callable = true`, Kent hides the protected Assignee Parameter on an override-enabled Edge, materializes that role automatically, and ignores any supplied Assignee value.
- When several roles are available, the protected Assignee Parameter is model-facing as an ordinary required string Parameter.
- The protected Assignee Parameter's default Key is `agent_role`.
- Assignee and thinking selectors own Protected Parameters with the lifecycle and edit behavior defined in the terminology specification.
- Ordinary and protected Parameter Keys remain unique across one Transition contract even while a protected Parameter is dormant.
- A supplied protected value is ignored only for retained-Session Assignee reuse, sole-role automation, or finite zero/one thinking automation. A value for a selector that is disabled, unavailable, or topology-inapplicable remains an unknown Transition Result output.
- A blank protected Assignee description derives `Override the subagent role for the next node, available roles: <CSV of roles in config.toml that have agent_callable=true>` when Workflow completion instructions are prepared.
- The derived Assignee list uses the server's loaded configuration and deterministic alphabetical order.
- A nonblank authored Assignee description replaces the derived description.
- Thinking selection uses a protected ordinary required string Parameter whose default Key is `thinking_level`.
- A blank protected thinking description derives `Override the thinking level for the next node, available levels: <CSV of levels supported by the target model>`.
- Thinking selection on a Transition without an Assignee override uses the target Node's configured Assignee provider and model.
- Thinking selection on a Transition with an Assignee override uses the union of finite catalog levels supported by the models of all explicitly agent-callable roles.
- Thinking selection is available when at least one applicable role resolves to a provider and model that support thinking.
- If any applicable model has no enumerable catalog contract, a Workflow Draft may retain a blank protected thinking description, but execution and Manual Move require a nonblank custom description.
- A selected role and thinking-level pair must be supported by that role's finite model-catalog contract when the protected thinking Parameter is exposed.
- When the selected role's model has no catalog contract, Kent accepts any nonblank thinking value after the required custom description is authored, and model execution may reject that value.
- When the finite thinking union is empty, Kent hides the protected thinking Parameter and preserves the selected role's ordinary configured thinking behavior.
- When the finite thinking union contains one level, Kent hides the protected thinking Parameter and applies that level only when the selected role's model supports it.
- A supplied thinking value is ignored whenever the protected thinking Parameter is hidden because the finite union contains zero or one level.
- Workflow definition validation checks each Edge selector's topology and configuration availability, protected Parameter identity, and every Agent Node's required fallback Assignee.
- Invalid selector modes, Parameter purposes, and malformed or colliding Parameter Keys are hard graph-shape errors. Selector topology and role/thinking catalog applicability are semantic validation errors: Drafts may save and reload them with diagnostics, while task creation and execution reject them.
- Kent validates supplied Assignee and thinking values when a Transition Result or Manual Move is applied and before creating a target Current Node or pending Approval.
- Each visible executable or terminal Node is also a Kanban column and status. Join Nodes are omitted from boards.
- Workflows can contain Start, Agent, Script, Join, and Terminal Nodes. Approval is a Transition Branch property.
- Each Workflow has exactly one Start Node. It is non-executable.
- For Task Start, the Start Node must have exactly one outgoing Transition with exactly one branch that targets an executable Node.
- Terminal Nodes are strict sinks. Manual reopen or rework is an explicit override, not retained Workflow history.
- Draft validation reports semantic errors but does not block save/link/default selection.
- Task creation and execution validation accumulate all safe actionable errors and reject invalid graph, role, and Parameter configurations.
- Execution-valid graphs reject detached islands: every node reachable from start, every non-terminal can reach terminal, terminal cannot auto-run.
- Cycles/self-loops are allowed outside restricted fan-out branch paths.
- New draft Nodes, Node Groups, Transitions, and Transition Branches receive UUID v4 identifiers. Preview and Save preserve those identifiers unchanged. Product-facing keys remain stable semantic references.
- `node_key`, `transition_id`, `edge_key`, Parameter Keys, and binding names match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`.
- Workflow display names are labels, not references, and are trimmed non-empty strings capped at 120 chars.

## Node Completion

- Agent Nodes complete by producing a Transition Result, not by returning ordinary natural language.
- A Transition Result selects an outgoing Transition and supplies the Transition Parameters that its targets require.
- Runtime failure, unanswered questions, interruption, and validation blockers are orchestration outcomes, not model-selected terminal statuses.
- Completion modes are `structured_output`, dynamic `complete_node` tool, `shell_command`, and `unstructured_output`. Global `[workflow].completion_mode` selects `auto`, `structured_output`, `tool`, `shell_command`, or `unstructured_output`; agent nodes can override it with the same values or inherit the global default.
- Start, join, and terminal nodes reject non-empty completion-mode overrides.
- A completion-mode override belongs to the source Agent Node, not to a Transition Branch. Transitions define the possible branches and Parameter Requirements.
- `auto` resolves when a Session Contract generation prepares its first model request after Session planning and tool availability are known: shell-unavailable agent execution uses `unstructured_output`; Workflows with any literal `continue_session` branch use `shell_command`; all other agent execution uses structured output when provider capabilities support it and dynamic tool mode otherwise. `compact_and_continue_session` does not trigger shell fallback. A Node-level `auto` override applies this policy even when the global config is a fixed mode.
- The first model request snapshots the effective completion mode into the Session Contract generation.
- Resume and `continue_session` reuse the retained Session Contract generation's effective completion mode even when the latest global setting or Agent Node override would select another mode. Full-history fan-out clones inherit the same effective completion mode.
- `new_session` creates a new Session, and `compact_and_continue_session` creates a new Session Contract generation. Only these Context-Preservation Modes may select a different effective completion mode for the target Agent Node.
- Resume resolves the latest Runtime Parameter Contract from the current Workflow definition. A live Exact Execution Scope keeps the completion contract already advertised for that scope until it stops.
- Forced `structured_output` fails fast with an actionable error when unsupported. Forced `tool` always uses dynamic tool mode. Forced `shell_command` fails execution start when the resolved runtime shell tool is unavailable.
- `[workflow].use_required_tool_calls` defaults to `true`. When enabled, each model response in `shell_command` and `tool` modes must call at least one available tool. This requirement does not add, remove, or reorder tools.
- When `[workflow].use_required_tool_calls` is `false`, model requests in `shell_command` and `tool` modes use automatic tool selection. The selected completion mode still rejects ordinary assistant final answers.
- Accepted live user steering re-enters the same live completion policy. `structured_output` and `unstructured_output` generation use automatic tool selection.
- Manual interruption releases the specialized Exact Execution Scope.
- If the retained Workflow Session still belongs to the interrupted Current Node, Kent may retain its Active Session Runtime for passive control without an Exact Execution Scope.
- In that retained control-only posture, Goal, settings, and valid Worktree controls remain available. Post-turn Queue input fails before acceptance and creates no Queue Item.
- A human Send/Steer to the retained Session and explicit Workflow Resume are two entry points into the same Current Node reactivation path. Both durably resume the interrupted Current Node and start a fresh Workflow Exact Execution Scope; Send/Steer additionally submits its human input to that reactivated execution.
- Send/Steer reactivation never starts an ordinary non-Workflow Session execution and never creates a second Transition authority. If the retained Session no longer belongs to that Current Node, reactivation fails before accepting the input.
- Send/Steer reactivation has the same completion contract and tool-choice policy as explicit Resume. It does not create a separate interactive completion mode.
- Resume starts a fresh Exact Execution Scope while retaining the Session Contract generation's effective completion mode.
- `complete_node` is always available in tool completion mode, regardless of the Assignee's configured tools.
- `shell_command` mode requires external structured completion rather than an ordinary assistant final answer.
- `unstructured_output` mode requires the assistant's final answer to be exactly one raw JSON object.
- Any assistant answer that would otherwise complete an active workflow-controlled Node must pass through that Node's current completion contract in every completion mode, whether or not the answer carries an explicit final-phase designation.
- Normal assistant final answers are invalid in `tool` and `shell_command` modes. Kent explains the invalid completion and continues until the agent completes correctly, asks a Question, is interrupted, reaches the invalid-attempt limit, or encounters an error.
- A completion payload contains only optional `transition`, optional `commentary`, and possible Transition Parameters as top-level properties. It never exposes `next_node`.
- Transition Parameter outputs are strings. Kent converts non-string JSON values to strings before binding them. A later Node never receives a structured Parameter value.
- Possible Transition Parameters are optional until Kent knows which Transition the agent selected. The selected Transition then determines which Parameters are required.
- Each required Transition Parameter must become a non-empty string after leading and trailing whitespace is removed.
- Size limits: Parameter Key `<= 64` chars, Parameter description `<= 1000`, Parameter value `<= 64 KiB`, commentary `<= 64 KiB`, task comment body `<= 256 KiB`.
- Completion-contract changes in `structured_output` and `tool` modes can change prompt-cache continuity. `shell_command` and `unstructured_output` preserve the completion contract in appended instructions instead.
- Kent accepts live Agent completion only when it identifies the matching Exact Execution Scope, Run, and Agent Step.
- Agent completion and Script completion use distinct typed operations. Agent completion requires Exact Execution Scope, Run, and Agent Step provenance and is valid only for a matching running Agent Step.
- Script completion requires the matching Script Exact Execution Scope and Script kind and requires no Session Runtime, Run, or Agent Step.
- Agent completion cannot target a Script Exact Execution Scope. Script completion cannot target an Agent Exact Execution Scope.
- After their distinct exact-kind and lifecycle validation, Agent and Script completion apply the same Current Node transition rules through the Workflow mutation owner. Human force-complete remains a separate Interrupt and Manual Move composition.
- Agent `kent task complete` obtains the current Run and Step from its Kent execution environment. Missing or invalid live completion identity fails before Kent requests a Workflow change. Other live completion modes use the identity of the Agent Step that produced the completion.
- Workflow completion is a direct exact-execution operation inside the protected Agent Step, not a Steering Intent. Tool completion returns synchronously without waiting for the Step Boundary.
- A stale or mismatched Exact Execution Scope, Run, or Agent Step changes no Workflow state.
- After terminal completion commits, the originating Agent Step remains open only for its caused tool/results and same-Step exact Goal admission. Kent retains that Scope, Run, and Agent Step provenance until the protected Step closes, while Stop, prompt answers, exact steer, and duplicate completion are unavailable.
- Human Steering accepted while that Agent Step is open applies after the Step but does not invalidate a valid completion or force that completed Workflow execution to continue. The text remains with the source Session and never transfers to a successor Session.
- Human input accepted after completion has made the old exact execution non-live may activate fresh interactive work in the source Session.
- After five invalid completion attempts, Kent interrupts the Current Node. `[workflow].max_invalid_completion_attempts` configures this limit and defaults to `5`.
- Workflow execution ends only after the Exact Execution Scope stops. The outcome is successful completion, a resumable blocked state, or a non-success terminal outcome.
- Workflow-controlled execution has no wall-clock time limit.

## Script Nodes

- Script nodes are first-class executable workflow nodes. They can be Start targets, fan-out branches, join predecessors/successors, manual automation targets, and board columns anywhere agent nodes are accepted by graph semantics.
- A Script Node can omit its script path in a Workflow Draft. A missing path, nonexistent path, directory, or non-executable file blocks execution, not draft editing.
- Relative script paths resolve against the task execution root. Absolute paths resolve on the Kent server host.
- Kent launches the resolved executable directly with the Execution Root as its working directory. It does not use a shell wrapper, retry the script, or impose a timeout, CPU quota, or memory quota.
- Kent bounds captured stdout and stderr independently.
- When interruption stops a Script Node process, Kent requests graceful termination and force-kills the process after a bounded grace period if it remains running.
- Script interruption has no Agent Runtime association. A Script is user-visible as running or not running. Cancellation, start failure, and process exit each enter the Script owner's exactly-once completion or interruption cleanup.
- Script exact execution starts without an Agent Runtime assignment or Runtime start state. Preparation creates no live Exact Execution Scope and does not make the Current Node running or interruptible. One short non-interruptible publication operation revalidates the expected Current Node and absence of conflicting live Script execution before it durably admits the Current Node and makes the Script execution visible together. If another Workflow lifecycle operation changed the expected Current Node first, Kent discards the prepared start, returns one typed unavailable or conflict result, preserves the winning Workflow state, and performs no interruption. If another publication precondition fails while the Current Node still matches, Kent discards the prepared start and attempts ordinary durable interruption; a definitely uncommitted interruption leaves it ready for retry. A committed admission makes the Script execution fully visible before process execution begins. A definitely uncommitted admission makes no Script execution visible and leaves the Current Node ready for retry. Indeterminate Workflow Store certainty is fatal. Manual Move and Task Interrupt that arrive during publication wait for running publication or failure, then use ordinary lifecycle ownership. A prepared Script start does not authorize standalone Task Interrupt.
- Internal Script cleanup does not create a user-visible lifecycle state, conflict surface, or outcome-precedence promise.
- Script input is one JSON object on standard input. Incoming Workflow Parameters are top-level properties. `_kent` is reserved for Task, Node, and parallel Transition Branch identity.
- Script stdout is parsed as the workflow completion JSON using the same completion contract as agent nodes. Stderr is diagnostics only and is not mixed into completion parsing.
- Invalid stdout, invalid script path, interruption, and execution errors leave the script's current Node interrupted with bounded structured details.
- Script completion applies the selected Transition and creates no retained execution history.
- Successful Script completion applies exactly one durable Current Node transition.
- A Script finishes through its ordinary direct completion and retirement path without Agent post-turn optimization.
- Resuming an interrupted Script Node runs the script again with its current inputs, the current script path, and the latest outgoing completion requirements.

## Workflow Prompting

- Workflow-controlled agent Sessions use dedicated workflow-mode developer instructions.
- Every Node Transition into an Agent Current Node materializes exactly one typed assignment for the target Session before its Exact Execution Scope begins.
- An automatic successor that receives its target assignment remains eligible to start exactly once even when Kent later reports a diagnostic for that assignment.
- An automatic successor that does not receive its target assignment becomes interrupted without interrupting or delaying a sibling successor that can start.
- Caller cancellation while Kent delivers an automatic successor's target assignment stops only that caller's observation. Server-owned assignment delivery and successor handling continue unchanged; an independent delivery failure still follows the ordinary actionable interruption path.
- When initial Task Start targets an Agent Node, it reaches cutover only with a validated assignment and prepared exact Session identity. Assignment persistence and Runtime startup occur after cutover as ordinary Current Node execution; only failures in that post-transition execution may interrupt the Current Node.
- Workflow preparation may resolve or change Session, execution-target, provider, assignment, and Current Node binding facts before durable Current Node admission.
- Competing preparations may therefore leave accepted Session-side effects. Kent does not promise side-effect-free losing preparation and does not roll back or compensate those effects.
- With an Active Session Runtime, the assignment follows the Session's first-in, first-out mutation order.
- Without an Active Session Runtime, the durable Session remains authoritative for assignment.
- Assignment acceptance opens human Send/Steer and short Session settings while startup is preparing.
- Post-turn Queue remains unavailable until an Agent Turn exists.
- Preparation creates no live Exact Execution Scope and does not make the Current Node running or interruptible.
- The first committed durable Current Node admission wins among competing starts.
- Immediately before admission, Workflow Execution checks that the expected Current Node still exists and no conflicting exact execution is live.
- If another Workflow lifecycle operation changed the Current Node first, Kent discards the losing start and preserves the winning Workflow state.
- A definitely uncommitted admission publishes no exact execution and leaves the Current Node available for explicit recovery.
- An indeterminate admission terminates the backend.
- The provider starts only after durable admission and matching exact execution are live.
- Session Runtime Authority owns exact start exclusion from publication through retirement.
- Existing explicit Resume durably requeues interrupted Current Nodes and queues their fresh explicit starts.
- Abrupt process death may occur before startup finishes.
- On the next startup, Kent marks affected executable Current Nodes interrupted.
- A direct Transition that continues the same Session without an Approval, pause, Session change, or intervening Node keeps that Active Session Runtime and Steers exactly one next assignment. Kent does not close and reopen the Runtime for that continuation.
- Context-Preservation Mode selects the target Session and assignment template. It does not change the Transition's ownership of assignment delivery.
- When a Node Transition continues a Session during an active model or tool turn, the target assignment must follow the source turn's durable tool result.
- Resume must not steer or append a Current Node assignment.
- When a Session's model context has no prior executable Node assignment, Kent uses the initial-assignment instructions.
- When a Session's model context already contains another executable Node assignment, Kent uses the reassignment instructions.
- Full-history fan-out clones use the reassignment instructions because they inherit the source Session's prior assignment context.
- `compact_and_continue_session` uses the reassignment instructions because it delivers another executable Node assignment.
- When Kent compacts the current Node assignment's context, it reinjects the compaction-reminder instructions for that same assignment.
- Post-completion compaction has no current executable assignment. Its replacement contains the completed-assignment summary and general Workflow instructions without a current-assignment reminder. Every later executable Node entry, including a return to the same Node key, appends reassignment instructions before its first model request.
- Prompt explains task identity, node role/assignee, selected completion behavior, question behavior, handoff/transition mechanics, task comments, and why ordinary final answers are invalid when the selected mode does not accept them.
- Agent Sessions created by Workflow Execution begin at subagent depth `0`. Delegation from a Workflow agent follows the global subagent-depth policy.
- Ordinary final response text cannot bypass the selected completion mode.
- Existing user goal state is not reused as workflow autonomy state.
- Workflow Task Sessions expose ordinary human `/goal` control. Goal mutations follow the same live Steering or dormant Store ownership as other Sessions.
- During live Workflow exact execution, Goal continuation remains passive.
- A retained Workflow control-only Runtime accepts only a no-op Goal mutation, a mutation that does not require new ordinary Goal execution, or a mutation already owned by the current Exact Execution Scope. It rejects a user Goal mutation that requires starting new ordinary Goal execution before acceptance.
- Goal Steering applied after terminal Workflow completion does not restart the completed execution or start a Goal loop from that completion boundary.
- Human input follows the [Runtime Steering And Model Loop](runtime-steering-loop.md) contract. Completion never transfers source-Session human text to a successor Session.
- Task Comment bodies are not added automatically to agent context. New Workflow instructions include the current visible Comment count and `kent task comment list <task>` when Comments exist. Kent never rewrites older model-visible instructions to update that count.
- Unsatisfied Task Dependencies use the same instruction lifecycle as Task
  Comment awareness.
- When one or more direct unsatisfied dependencies exist, new Workflow
  instructions include the current count and `kent task show <task-short-id>`.
- Workflow instructions do not embed related Task bodies or relationship lists.
- Kent never rewrites older model-visible instructions when relationships or
  dependency satisfaction changes.

## Questions And Approvals

- A Workflow Question is a Session Question created through `ask_question`.
- A model does not report `needs_user_input` as a completion status; it calls `ask_question`.
- The Session's current executable Node pauses until the Question is answered.
- All clients use the same authoritative Question and Approval state. A client marks an interaction resolved only after Kent accepts the answer.
- A Question belongs to its Session. Workflow attention refers to that Question and does not create a second Task-owned copy.
- Workflow Question attention carries Session, Step, and Tool Call ID only in its Question payload. The attention item and its Current Node do not repeat Question Session identity.
- Live Questions and live Approvals exist only within their Exact Execution Scope. Process death does not restore them, replay answers, or apply a blocked Workflow effect. The affected Current Node follows ordinary lost-execution interruption behavior.
- The bounded active Session transcript supplies Question content to read surfaces. An unfinished transcript operation without a matching Exact Execution Scope does not create a live Question or `waiting_question` Task status.
- A pending Workflow Transition Approval belongs to the current Task and survives restart.
- Approval is a Transition Branch property.
- If any branch of a selected Transition requires Approval, the complete Transition waits for one Approval before any target becomes current or begins work.
- A pending Approval freezes the selected Transition, its branches, Workflow Version, source and target Nodes, effective branch configuration, display details, and Context Source.
- A pending Approval also freezes the selected target Assignee and thinking values.
- Kent validates and materializes the selected target Assignee and thinking before it creates the pending Approval.
- Approval inserts the frozen target without consulting the current Workflow graph or role/thinking configuration.
- If later configuration cannot instantiate the already approved Assignee or thinking value, the resulting Current Node reports an ordinary start failure; that failure does not change Approval semantics.
- After completion has selected an Approval, the Workflow owner finishes, skips, or surfaces any source Workflow Pre-Compaction before it applies that Approval. This is ordinary Workflow-owner sequencing, not a Runtime gate or completion fence.
- Later graph edits do not change what the approving caller approves.
- Applied and rejected Transitions are not retained as workflow movement history. Pending Approval state is removed when the Approval applies or a manual move supersedes it.
- A Task awaiting Approval remains at the source current Node and exposes `waiting_approval` status; target Nodes are not current.
- Pending Approvals occur only after a Task has reached an executable Node and therefore always reuse the Task's locked Execution Target.

## Manual Movement

- Manual movement acts on the Task, never on one Current Node. A successful move replaces every origin Current Node.
- Moving a Backlog Task through its Start Node's outgoing Transition is Task Start, not a manual override.
- Dropping a Task onto any Node that is already Current is a no-op, including a drop from one parallel card copy onto another Current Node in the same parallel group.
- A manual move to an Agent or Script Node selects a usable incoming Transition that contains the destination. The Transition does not need to originate from a Current Node.
- Kent selects the Transition automatically when exactly one usable incoming Transition contains the destination. The operator chooses when several are usable, and Kent rejects the move when none are usable.
- The selected Transition is the unit of movement. A serial Transition creates its single target Current Node; a Fan-Out Transition creates every target Current Node and cannot be used to start only one branch.
- A serial incoming Transition inside a Fan-Out branch path is not usable for Manual Move because it cannot recreate the sibling branch positions required by the Join. The operator must select the Fan-Out Transition that starts the complete parallel group or choose a destination outside that parallel section.
- Manual movement applies every selected Transition Branch's Parameters, context behavior, and target requirements as normal Workflow entry would.
- Kent presents every required Parameter value before movement. Values already available from the Task are prefilled and remain editable; the operator supplies unresolved values and may override prefilled values.
- Manual Move presents exposed protected Assignee and thinking Parameters through the ordinary required-value fields and applies the same selection validation.
- Manual Move hides and ignores the protected Assignee value for retained-Session reuse and hides either protected value when its selector resolves automatically from zero or one option.
- A protected value hidden because its selector is disabled, unavailable, or topology-inapplicable is not part of the completion contract and remains an unknown extra value.
- Deliberately selecting an Approval-gated Transition counts as its Approval.
- Kent applies that move without creating another Approval.
- Task Start and manual movement into executable work make no Task change while Execution Target selection is required. Dismissal leaves the Task unchanged.
- Workflow lifecycle mutations serialize within one Task. A lifecycle mutation or Runtime assignment wait for one Task must not delay lifecycle mutations for another Task.
- Task, board, list, and search reads combine durable Workflow state with stale-tolerant Immutable Live Snapshots. They never wait for Workflow lifecycle ownership or Runtime live-state ownership, may combine facts captured at different moments, and may temporarily lag or omit current activity until a later refresh.
- Read-model actions, including the Interrupt affordance, inherit that stale-tolerant contract and do not acquire Runtime ownership for freshness. Accepting Interrupt revalidates exact live execution and may reject an action offered from an older snapshot.
- Stale live facts must not authorize a Workflow mutation. Lifecycle owners revalidate exact Runtime activity and Task Quiescence when applying an action.
- After required selection, Task Start remains one server-owned lifecycle operation while it resolves the Execution Target, prepares the Execution Root and retry-safe setup, prepares the first executable Node's runtime plan, and, for an Agent target, prepares its Session plan and reserves its exact Session identity. The Task remains at Start/Backlog throughout preparation and has no durable `starting` state, executable Current Node, Task-owned Session provenance, or setup-recovery item.
- Successful Task Start performs one metadata transaction that locks the prepared Execution Target and Execution Root and replaces Start with the first executable Current Node. For an Agent target, the same transaction records Session Task ownership, exact Workflow provenance, and the Current Node's exact Session binding. The Task becomes started only at that commit.
- Task Start preparation uses only idempotent or retry-convergent effects. Failure before the cutover leaves the Task at Start and unlocked; a later Start retries safely and may reuse or safely recreate provisional resources. Kent adds no durable partial-start, rollback, recovery, or reconciliation state.
- Server restart performs no Task Start recovery. Before the cutover, a restart leaves the Task at Start and a later Start retries preparation; after the cutover, the Task is ordinarily started. Runtime launch after the cutover follows normal Current Node execution and failure semantics.
- Concurrent Task Start requests serialize through the Task lifecycle owner from Start validation through cutover. Losing, canceling, or closing the initiating client connection stops only that client's observation; it never cancels, pauses, retries, or otherwise changes Task Start.
- Once a Manual Move is ready to apply and any required Execution Target selection has succeeded, Kent automatically interrupts all live Agent and Script work on the Task, waits for it to stop, revalidates the move, and applies it. A separate Interrupt action is not required.
- As part of that interruption, Manual Move cancels every pending Question and denies and removes every pending Approval on the Task before applying the move. A direct Manual Move and a concurrent live Approval answer race at the exact live tool call owner. If the Approval is accepted first, Manual Move waits for that acceptance and then continues its interruption and move. If Manual Move closes the Approval first, the answer is Skipped without commentary.
- Human `kent task complete --force` composes Task Interrupt and Manual Move. It explicitly interrupts and waits first, then invokes this same Manual Move owner with the selected outgoing Transition, commentary, and Parameter values; it is not another completion authority. Its Manual Move phase must not publish an already-closed Approval again, block on it, or apply its commentary.
- Other conflicting lifecycle operations block Manual Move.
- If revalidation or movement fails before the move commits and after live work has been interrupted, the origin Current Nodes remain interrupted and Kent surfaces the move failure instead of resuming them.

## Context Preservation And Bindings

- Each Transition Branch supports `new_session`, `continue_session`, or `compact_and_continue_session`.
- Workflow-created Session copies preserve delegation ancestry and do not reset delegation depth.
- Continuation modes may select `immediate_source`, `node:<node_key>`, `previous_target`, or `previous_target_or_new` as context source.
- `immediate_source` uses the Session bound to the source Current Node during normal completion. During Manual Move, it uses that Session when the source is Current, otherwise the latest retained unscoped Session associated with the selected Transition's source Node.
- `node:<node_key>` selects the latest retained Session associated with the guaranteed-prior agent Node.
- `previous_target` selects the latest retained Session associated with the target agent Node and fails when none exists.
- `previous_target_or_new` selects that Session when one exists and otherwise starts a new Session.
- During parallel work, each Context Source selection stays within the source Current Node's Transition Branch Key.
- Reaching a Join ends active branch flow but does not remove retained branch-scoped Session associations. A later legal fan-out cycle may select the prior association for the same Transition Branch Key through `previous_target` or `previous_target_or_new`.
- Manual movement supports every Context Source. An incoming Transition is usable only when every selected branch can resolve any Session required by its Context Source.
- Manual movement never infers one origin branch from a parallel Task or from the dragged card. During parallel work it does not preserve branch-scoped Session context. When the selected Transition source is not the Task's sole unscoped Current Node, required retained-Session context resolves only from serial associations; branch-scoped-only context makes the Transition unusable. A selected Fan-Out Transition resolves context before its targets receive their new Transition Branch Keys.
- Pending Approvals freeze context-source resolution before Approval. A fallback-to-new result remains `new_session` even if another matching Session appears before Approval, and a selected Session remains fixed if a newer matching Session appears.
- If a fresh retained-target Session binds but later start preparation fails, Resume reports the invalid binding and does not create another Session. Recovery requires operator intervention.
- `continue_session` may reuse only a Session whose persisted Assignee identity matches the target Current Node's materialized Assignee.
- Workflow validation rejects statically known Assignee incompatibility, runtime rejects retained-Session Assignee incompatibility, and valid direct continuation preserves the reused Session's Assignee, contract generation, and cache lineage.
- Transition-selected Assignees never rotate or invalidate an established Session's prompt-cache lineage.
- A retained Session may adopt the target Current Node's materialized thinking without rotating or invalidating its prompt-cache lineage.
- `compact_and_continue_session` compacts the reused Session and establishes the target Current Node's materialized Assignee and thinking in a fresh contract generation, resolving current role configuration for model/provider setup, generation parameters, capabilities, enabled tools, native web-search mode, prompt snapshots, context budget, and prompt-facing request content.
- Eager and lazy compaction must use the outgoing Session's model configuration and Thinking. Kent must apply the target configuration only after compaction succeeds and must not add configuration-reminder messages.
- For a direct automatic Compact-and-Continue transition, the outgoing Exact Execution Scope must compact before handing the retained Active Session Runtime to the target. An Idle Session must use a separate pre-target compaction execution. Task Interrupt must remain available during either compaction.
- For lazy Compact-and-Continue, Manual Move must commit its selected target before compaction. If compaction fails or is interrupted, the target must remain interrupted and the outgoing Session configuration must remain unchanged. Kent must preserve cache-relevant request settings and the dispatched input prefix until summary replacement; provider cache availability remains provider-dependent.
- `new_session` establishes the target Current Node's materialized Assignee and thinking at its fresh context boundary and resolves current role configuration for that Assignee.
- Kent derives `compact_and_continue_session` timing from the accepted Workflow path. Workflow authors do not configure eager or lazy timing.
- Guaranteed future reuse compacts eagerly after the source assignment completes, regardless of context usage. Reuse is guaranteed when at least one branch that the accepted fan-out will execute guarantees it; unrelated accepted siblings do not need to reuse the Session.
- Optional future reuse compacts after source completion only when Workflow Pre-Compaction reaches its threshold. Otherwise lazy compaction occurs when the selected target starts.
- Kent derives guarantee from every valid path to a reachable Terminal Node after narrowing the graph to the accepted Transition. Unselected outgoing alternatives, manual movement, later Workflow edits, Task deletion, and restart do not affect the classification. A decision cycle with an exit does not become optional merely because execution may revisit that cycle.
- When static Session provenance cannot prove that every terminal path reaches compact-and-continue reuse, Kent treats that reuse as optional rather than eager.
- Guarantee and eligibility follow all Context Source semantics, including direct and transitive `immediate_source`, `node:<node_key>`, `previous_target`, and `previous_target_or_new`. A source that may fall back to a new Session remains optional unless the accepted path guarantees selection of the retained Session.
- Eager `compact_and_continue_session` and threshold-triggered Workflow Pre-Compaction share one post-completion history replacement. A later target establishes its fresh Session Contract and appends its assignment without producing a second summary for the already-compacted history. The selected Session's prompt-cache key remains its Kent Session ID.
- A target skips its lazy CAC summary only when the selected Session has an unconsumed committed Workflow Pre-Compaction replacement. Otherwise CAC runs when the target starts.
- Nodes own no agent input or output contract. Transition Branches exclusively declare the Parameters they provide to their targets.
- Prompt placeholders validate against the prompt-owning Transition Branch's Parameters through `.Params.<parameter_key>`.
- Applying a Transition materializes each branch's declared Parameters for its target. Prompt rendering uses those values and never searches discarded execution history.
- Built-in [Session references](workflow-editor.md#session-references) resolve the Task's existing Session associations when the prompt is rendered.
- If the latest Workflow definition requires an already-current executable Node to have a Transition-owned Parameter that was not materialized when the Node was entered, that Current Node cannot Resume and reports a typed validation error. Kent does not reconstruct discarded Workflow history, and another selected parallel Current Node remains independently admissible.
- The Start Node's outgoing Transition cannot declare Parameters and should use task fields such as `.TaskTitle` and `.TaskBody`.
- Kent derives Parameter flow and completion requirements from Transition Branch declarations, Workflow structure, and Join sources.

## Workflow Pre-Compaction

- Workflow Pre-Compaction remains separate from ordinary-session eager compaction. Ordinary eager compaction never runs for a Workflow Session.
- `[workflow].pre_compaction_tokens` is a root config-file setting with no environment or per-subagent override.
- When omitted, the Workflow Pre-Compaction threshold is 70% of `context_compaction_threshold_tokens`, rounded down to a whole token. An explicit value must be positive and no greater than that ordinary threshold; equality is valid.
- Workflow Pre-Compaction uses the same authoritative context-usage value and compaction operation as ordinary context management. It does not introduce another token measurement authority.
- Workflow Pre-Compaction triggers when authoritative context usage is at or above its threshold.
- `compaction_mode = "none"` disables threshold-triggered Workflow Pre-Compaction. Authored `compact_and_continue_session` remains disabled; Kent never silently treats it as `continue_session`.
- Kent evaluates a just-completed Agent Session only after its completion result and handoff are durable and only when the accepted Workflow can later select that retained Session.
- Human forced completion uses Manual Move and does not run source-completion Workflow Pre-Compaction.
- Terminal-only or unreachable reuse is ineligible. A direct same-Session continuation without Approval is also ineligible because the Session does not structurally become dormant; later admission, capacity, or startup delay does not change that decision.
- An Approval wait makes the completed Session dormant and eligible. Kent starts eligible compaction after the terminal output is durable. While live source finalization runs, Workflow lifecycle sequencing prevents Approval apply.
- The compaction request uses the pre-compaction cache key and includes the durable completed assignment and handoff. The replacement summary describes that assignment as completed and cannot present it as still in progress.
- A successful replacement does not change the retained Session's prompt-cache key. Ordinary `continue_session` and `compact_and_continue_session` keep using that Kent Session ID; changed Workflow assignment and Session Contract content naturally invalidate the changed request prefix.
- Fan-out compacts the source history once before Session copies are created. Reusing successors receive the same summary with distinct fresh cache keys.
- Workflow Pre-Compaction is best-effort after durable completion and never rolls back the completed Current Node.
- A committed replacement remains the authoritative Workflow Pre-Compaction boundary even when later finalization reports an error.
- A later `compact_and_continue_session` target does not create a second summary for a committed Workflow Pre-Compaction boundary.
- An uncommitted replacement leaves no Workflow Pre-Compaction boundary.
- Threshold-only work proceeds without pre-compaction after an uncommitted replacement.
- After an uncommitted replacement, authored `compact_and_continue_session` compacts when its target starts.
- After compaction succeeds, fails, or is canceled, the durable successor or Pending Approval eventually becomes available through ordinary Workflow continuation exactly once.
- Nonfatal post-completion diagnostics do not fail or interrupt the already-completed source.
- An Approval source remains waiting for Approval.
- Cancellation before durable completion follows the source execution's ordinary failure behavior.

## Parallelism And Joins

- A Fan-Out Transition adds several parallel target Nodes to the Task's Current Nodes.
- Branches are ordinary workflow nodes, not subtasks.
- The GUI saves Node Groups only as execution-shaped parallel groups. A Node Group contains branch Nodes and one Join. One Fan-Out Transition targets its branches.
- A Task may have several Current Nodes only when the graph explicitly fans out.
- Joins wait for all required inputs. Kent does not support racing or first-success parallel branches.
- Fan-out topology must have exactly one unambiguous nearest common join reachable from every branch.
- Branch paths before that join may not terminate, enter nested fan-out, or contain cycles.
- Kent rejects ambiguous or complex fan-out.
- Current fan-out state retains the expected Transition Branch Keys and materialized branch inputs only until the Join completes.
- Later graph edits do not change an in-flight fan-out's expected branch set.
- Join Nodes are non-agent fan-in points. They combine inbound Parameter values deterministically and then apply their outgoing Transition.
- Agent synthesis belongs in a normal Agent Node after the Join.
- Orchestrators cannot create Workflow Nodes or Kanban columns dynamically.

## Workflow Execution And Restart

- Workflow Execution is the single authority for Workflow lifecycle changes. It sequences conflicting operations and reports authoritative live state.
- Workflow Execution serializes only short Task and Current Node decisions and commits. It releases that ownership before Runtime waits, provider or Script execution, Worktree work, and other long-running owners.
- Requests to start eligible work automatically are temporary. Kent loses them on restart and does not reconstruct them from saved Task state.
- Workflow automation starts Agent Nodes within available agent capacity and prefers to continue related work on the same Task. `[workflow].concurrency` limits these agent runs only.
- Script Nodes do not wait for or consume agent-run capacity. Kent does not limit concurrent Script Node runs.
- When Agent and Script Nodes are both eligible within their applicable capacity, Kent gives neither kind priority. The same-Task continuation preference applies across both kinds.
- Explicit Start, Resume, approval, and executable manual move may exceed the agent concurrency limit without preempting other work.
- Resuming a Task whose automatic Agent Current Nodes are waiting for capacity promotes those queued Nodes into explicit admission. The same Resume action covers an automatically queued first execution and a queued continuation.
- Public Task Resume classifies and requeues every eligible interrupted Current Node on the Task.
- Resume returns after it durably requeues the interrupted Current Nodes and queues their explicit starts.
- Resume does not wait for Execution Target restoration, Session setup, or agent or Script startup.
- Retained-Session Send/Steer resolves one exact Session, Current Node, and parallel branch.
- Retained-Session Send/Steer requeues and starts only that selected Current Node.
- Sibling validation or startup failure cannot fail the selected submission or start sibling work.
- Retained-Session input is accepted only after that selected Current Node has a matching fresh live Workflow Agent execution.
- Matching live Agent execution remains interruptible while running or waiting for a Question or live Approval.
- A running Script is also interruptible.
- A queued Agent or Script alone does not authorize Interrupt.
- If startup admission is in progress, an otherwise authorized Task Interrupt waits for that short Workflow decision to finish, then interrupts matching live work if present.
- A Workflow-completed Agent Step and a finalizing Agent are not interruptible while their Exact Execution Scope remains only for Step closure or retirement.
- Start and Resume admit selected parallel branches independently. A failed branch does not undo or block a sibling that started successfully.
- Resume starts a fresh Exact Execution Scope only after the previous scope has fully stopped. Steering remains within the current scope.
- Restart does not restore live Questions, live Approvals, Automatic Intents, or Exact Execution Scopes. Kent marks each affected executable Current Node interrupted with a restart reason.
- A pending Transition Approval survives restart with the exact frozen Transition that the operator saw.
- Resume does not replay answers or apply a Workflow effect blocked by a prior durability failure.
- Kent never retries an interrupted Current Node automatically.
- Task Interrupt can target one Session or every live Agent and Script execution on the Task, including an Agent waiting for a Question or live Approval.
- State without matching exact live execution is not interruptible.
- Clients offer Interrupt only while Kent reports matching active execution. Kent checks again before interrupting and makes no change if execution has already stopped.
- Saved state without matching live execution never becomes interruptible or completion-authoritative as a fallback.
- Live completion can change a Task only from the matching Exact Execution Scope, Run, and Agent Step. A stopped scope and a non-current Node cannot change Task state. Human forced completion is the Interrupt-then-Manual-Move composition defined above.
- Completion replaces source Current Nodes, materializes target inputs, and adds target Current Nodes as one atomic change.
- Runtime failures, crashes, interruptions, and fixable start-validation blockers leave the affected Current Node interrupted with a reason.
- `failed` is reserved for unrecoverable corrupted Workflow state.
- Kent retains no completed execution or Workflow-movement history.
- Tasks support Interrupt and Delete. They do not have a separate Cancel operation.

## Task Status And Listing

- Task Search, Task detail, Workflow boards, and Task lists use one server-owned authoritative Task-status projection derived from Current Nodes, pending Workflow Transition Approvals, and current live activity.
- The projection supplies primary status, every applicable attention kind and reference, available Task actions, and the exact Current Node, Session, or Script targets for those actions. A surface may omit fields it does not expose, but does not independently recompute lifecycle-sensitive facts.
- Each request independently loads durable Task facts and owner-local immutable live projections, then derives the complete projection from those facts. The facts may be stale and may represent different completed moments.
- Each request is independent. Kent does not synchronize separate Search, List, Board, and Detail requests, so they may observe different lifecycle moments.
- Agreement among List/Search status filtering, status sorting, and returned status is not a product invariant. Each evaluation still follows the authoritative Task-status semantics.
- Projected actions and targets are hints that may become stale after the response. Each Task-changing operation checks its authoritative state again before changing the Task.
- If required durable or live facts cannot be read, the request fails instead of returning a partial projection or using a surface-specific fallback.
- Workflow attention has a global paginated Inbox and a bounded Task-specific feed. It has no Project-specific feed.
- Workflow attention is task-scoped. It includes only unresolved Questions, unresolved Workflow Approvals, and executable Nodes interrupted by errors.
- Workflow validity is not attention and does not create Inbox items.
- Core Task detail includes an unresolved-attention count but not the attention items. It does not scan transcript history.
- The Task-specific attention feed can read the newest active transcript segment to recover unresolved Question content. Desktop Task detail loads this feed independently so it does not delay core Task detail.
- Task Activity is a server-paginated projection of durable Comments and retained Session creation. It contains no workflow movement, Node completion, interruption, attempt, or diagnostic history. Clients render Session creation as localized `Session started` activity.
- Task Activity uses the offset pagination contract defined below.
- Task Activity requests may omit offset and limit. An omitted offset starts at zero, offsets are zero-based and non-negative, and an omitted limit defaults to 100 with a maximum of 100.
- Task Activity pagination is stateless between requests. The server bounds each response by the requested limit and does not retain page contents or pagination state.
- Insertions, removals, or reordering between independent Task Activity requests may cause later results to repeat or skip items.
- Task Activity orders items by occurrence time descending, then Activity ID descending. A Comment occurrence uses the Comment's latest update time. A Session-start occurrence uses the Session's creation time.
- Task detail reports the total retained Session count. It provides direct Open and Interrupt actions only for agent Sessions with live Exact Execution Scopes; non-live Sessions remain available through the Session picker.
- Desktop shows Task-wide Interrupt when several Exact Execution Scopes are live or a Script Node is live.
- Task status is structured and independent of a specific client. Each client renders and localizes it.
- One primary status uses this precedence: done, live question, live or persisted workflow approval, running, queued, interrupted, backlog, active.
- Running and live-Question status require matching Exact Execution Scope evidence. `queued` requires either a matching queued Exact Execution Scope or Workflow Execution's live automatic-concurrency queue ownership. `running` means an agent loop or Script process is actively executing; `waiting_question` is not running and is not interruptible. Durable Current Node scheduling state and interruption metadata never prove liveness.
- Task information exposes `can_delete` from the same live state. Delete treats this as a hint and checks Quiescence again before making changes.
- Task status preserves every applicable attention kind and its Session and Current Node references when parallel branches differ.
- Workflow validity is workflow-level state and is not a task status.
- Task lists expose typed Task status and attention filters. They expose no separate execution status or execution-count concept.
- Task lists are Project-scoped. A Project-only Task list spans every Workflow linked to that Project. An explicit Workflow selection narrows the list and must identify an active link in that Project.
- Each Project-wide Task-list request decides whether rows need Workflow names from the complete current filtered result set. Workflow-name visibility may change between offset requests when the matching set changes.
- A project with no linked workflows, an explicitly selected workflow that is not linked to the project, and workflow-relative operations without a workflow selector return distinct typed actionable errors.
- No-linked-workflow recovery directs the operator to create and link a workflow or list and link an existing workflow before retrying.
- Explicit not-linked recovery offers project workflow discovery and retry with a linked workflow, or linking the selected workflow to the project.
- Workflow-relative column recovery offers project workflow discovery and a task-list retry with an explicit workflow while preserving the parsed filters.
- Task-list status sorting follows primary typed-status precedence; Workflow-narrowed column sorting follows Workflow column position.

## Task Search

- Task search reuses the authoritative Task status defined above.
- [CLI Commands](cli-commands.md) owns the complete Task Search command contract.
- Search returns Task status from the server-owned Task-status projection.
- Each response independently loads the durable facts used for matching text, counts, filters, and Task metadata and combines them with owner-local immutable live projections. The facts may be stale and may represent different completed moments.

## Execution Targets And Worktrees

- A workflow execution target policy is evaluated only when an unlocked task first reaches an executable node through task start or manual movement.
- No managed worktree uses the source workspace as the execution root, supports non-Git workspaces, and creates no branch or worktree and runs no worktree setup.
- A no-managed-worktree target follows the task's current source workspace. Changing that workspace intentionally changes later execution roots.
- Source `HEAD`, repository default branch, and custom Git ref resolve to an immutable commit before managed-worktree creation. A custom ref accepts any Git revision that resolves to a commit.
- Repository default branch uses configured local remote-HEAD metadata: `origin` when configured, otherwise one unambiguous configured remote HEAD. Kent does not contact remotes or guess branch names; missing or ambiguous metadata makes the configured target unavailable.
- `ask_on_first_execution` and an unavailable configured target use the same task-local selection flow. They offer no managed worktree, source `HEAD`, repository default branch, and custom Git ref.
- For `ask_on_first_execution`, repository default branch is preselected. For an unavailable configured target, the configured mode and custom-ref input remain selected when useful; otherwise repository default branch is preselected.
- An unresolvable configured target asks the operator to select a concrete target and explains which configured target failed and why. During Task Start, this happens before cutover and leaves the Task at Start; Resume requests a concrete target before it requeues an unlocked Current Node.
- Selection-required results distinguish two reasons: the Workflow requires selection, or the configured target is unavailable. Every selection flow offers all four concrete modes.
- Failure to resolve an explicitly selected custom ref is a validation failure. During Task Start it occurs before cutover, leaves the Task at Start, and does not recursively request selection or fall back to another target. A later Start may select another concrete target.
- A Task locks target-selection provenance only after preparation establishes a usable Execution Root and any required setup succeeds. Initial Task Start locks that provenance in the same metadata transaction that materializes its first executable Current Nodes and exact Agent Session bindings. Setup failure leaves the Task unlocked.
- A Task with recorded managed-worktree facts but no locked execution-target provenance does not infer an execution root from its recorded `HEAD`; it remains readable but requires an explicit target selection before execution.
- An unlocked Task follows its configured Workflow execution-target policy. Kent does not use recorded managed-worktree facts as a source-`HEAD` fallback.
- Managed targets use ordinary Kent-managed Worktree creation and setup behavior, with Task-specific initial branch selection and collision behavior defined below. Before initial Task Start materializes the first executable Current Nodes, it loads worktree setup settings from the Task's source workspace. A configured setup script must succeed for a worktree created by that operation.
- Every Kent-managed Worktree root must resolve within the Worktree Base Dir and must not overlap its source Workspace in either direction. An explicit managed Worktree root that violates either condition is rejected before Worktree creation.
- A persisted managed Worktree root outside the Worktree Base Dir causes Session activation and Worktree restoration to fail. Kent does not migrate that root automatically.
- During execution-root preparation, each Workflow Task Start, Resume, or Move operation runs a required managed-worktree setup script at most once and produces its terminal preparation outcome from that attempt. Kent performs no automatic setup retry. Resume still acknowledges durable requeue before preparation completes; Task Start reports applied only after its atomic cutover, and Manual Move remains synchronous. Kent discards or recreates only an empty provisional root or one unchanged from its original checkout. Kent preserves operator and setup changes so a later explicit operation reruns setup in place. Setup scripts must tolerate repeated execution across explicit operations. Loading setup settings is preparation for the operation, not a setup attempt.
- If setup fails, Task Start remains at Start and unlocked, Resume leaves the Current Node interrupted, and Move leaves the action unapplied and unscheduled. Kent retains the worktree and reports its path, the setup script, the setup error, and the applicable explicit retry or target-selection actions.
- Setup runs when an operation creates or recreates a worktree root and when a later explicit operation retries a provisional root after setup failure. Setup does not rerun for an existing compatible root after setup has succeeded.
- CLI Task Start waits for preparation and the atomic cutover for at most two minutes. A committed Start succeeds; a terminal preparation failure fails with the typed retry or target-selection outcome. Timeout or lost observation fails with Task-inspection guidance, but the server-owned Start operation continues and the CLI does not replay it. CLI Resume receives the durable requeue result without waiting for preparation, then observes the correlated setup operation for at most two minutes under its existing outcome rules. Manual Move remains synchronous.
- When no setup script is configured, the setup result remains `not_required` even if target replacement retained a previous worktree. The result includes that retained worktree so CLI can provide cleanup guidance.
- Manual Move has no Worktree Setup correlation or attempt-progress stream. CLI and Desktop show their ordinary pending state until the synchronous Move response returns. A successful Move includes any previous worktree retained while replacing the provisional target. Actual setup-script failure uses the typed retained-setup error and includes the retained primary worktree, setup script, final diagnostic, and any previous retained worktree. Other target-preparation, revalidation, and lifecycle failures retain their ordinary error behavior.
- Desktop keeps failed Manual Move recovery in the originating route. It preserves the original Move input and whether the failed request used configured policy or an explicit target, then offers Retry current target, Choose another Execution Target, and Cancel. These actions are client-owned presentation derived from the typed result; the server does not return GUI action labels.
- After Resume setup recovery fails, one deterministic interrupted Current Node is the canonical recovery item for that setup operation. Other interrupted Current Nodes from the same failure are informational and do not offer Resume. Initial Task Start failure creates no interrupted Current Node or recovery item.
- A retry-ready target-preparation failure may have no retained primary worktree. Its canonical recovery item still carries the typed cause, diagnostic, and setup-operation identity and offers Retry or another Execution Target.
- Desktop attention opens Task detail at the exact canonical recovery item using its Current Node and setup-operation identity. While canonical setup recovery exists, that item owns the Task's only Resume control; the Task action area and sibling interruption items do not offer Resume.
- Canonical Resume offers Retry setup, Choose another Execution Target, and Cancel. Retry setup resubmits the exact concrete Execution Target selection carried by the canonical recovery item and does not resolve the current Workflow policy again. Choose another Execution Target replaces that selection. Cancel closes the dialog without resolving the interruption, so the canonical Resume control can reopen it.
- Actionable live setup-recovery attention is published only after the failed preparation no longer owns Task execution. If a durable attention snapshot exposes the canonical item earlier, Resume waits until that ownership boundary is safe before applying.
- Failure to persist the interruption is non-retryable for that operation. Kent surfaces the operational failure and retires the failed preparation; it does not retain a process-local recovery owner or promise automatic reconciliation.
- Before target lock, selecting another concrete target removes an empty or unchanged provisional worktree. Kent otherwise preserves it intact as a registered worktree no longer associated with the Task. CLI warns the operator, and Worktree list continues to show the retained worktree.
- Setup receives the source workspace root, branch name, and managed worktree root as stable positional inputs.
- Workflow Task setup has no Session identity. Its JSON input represents the Session as `null`, and its Session environment value is absent. Session-originated setup supplies the requesting Session identity in both inputs.
- Kent-provided setup inputs are authoritative. Conflicting inherited process values cannot provide or override Kent-reserved setup inputs.
- A managed target remains tied to its original source workspace, but its current root, metadata binding, branch history, and named branch may change.
- Before execution Kent validates that the bound root is the exact worktree root for the source repository. Initial managed-worktree creation and conservative repair establish a named branch; an available locked worktree remains valid at either a named branch or detached `HEAD` for resume and subsequent workflow execution. Kent never compares current history or HEAD with the originally resolved commit.
- When a locked managed root or its Kent association is missing, the initiating operation can restore an existing named branch at an available managed root and run setup for the recreated root.
- Conservative repair never recreates a missing branch from the old base commit, overwrites an existing directory, resets or renames a branch, accepts detached HEAD, repairs another repository, or infers ownership by scanning arbitrary roots. Unsafe or ambiguous states return one typed locked-target error with a small product-level cause.
- Outside the Compatibility Data case where a managed Worktree root equals its source Workspace root, there is no locked-target replacement flow. A locked target is never converted to no managed worktree.
- Task detail always shows the source workspace. An unlocked Task remains readable and does not show a provisional worktree as its Task worktree. After target lock, Task detail also shows the recorded target provenance and managed-worktree path when present. Task detail does not inspect live path availability or the current Git branch; Worktree status owns those live facts.
- An unlocked Task that remains at the Start Node may carry a provisional managed Worktree from an earlier setup failure. That relation does not mean the Task was started: ordinary Task Start, including an explicit concrete target selection, may reuse or safely recreate the provisional root and locks target facts only after setup succeeds.
- Human task detail shortens the resolved commit for readability. Structured JSON retains the full commit value.
- An unlocked Task without a managed Worktree has a pending initial managed branch name initialized from its Task Short ID.
- Task Start, Manual Move, and Resume may replace the pending initial managed branch name when the operation can create the Task's first managed Worktree and the Task is not yet bound to one.
- Pending branch selection is Task-scoped last-write-wins state until fresh Worktree materialization snapshots the pending value immediately before creation. That snapshot fixes the branch for the in-flight creation. A replacement accepted after the snapshot does not alter that creation and may be cleared without being materialized when the Worktree binds.
- Manual Move rejects an explicit branch name before returning a no-op or a result that does not require Execution Target preparation. It does not change the Task or its pending branch in either case.
- An operation selecting no managed worktree rejects an explicit branch name. Locking that Execution Target consumes the pending branch choice.
- Before an initiating operation changes Task state, Kent validates the pending branch with Git branch-name rules and rejects an exact matching local branch or locally available remote-tracking branch on any configured remote. Kent does not contact or fetch remotes for collision detection, and a same-named tag is not a branch collision.
- Kent repeats the point-in-time collision check immediately before Worktree creation. Git branch creation rejects a matching local branch created after that check. Task Start remains at Start and unapplied. Manual Move remains unapplied. Resume returns applied after queueing its Current Nodes, then interrupts them when asynchronous preparation reports the collision. A matching remote-tracking ref created after the final check may coexist with the new local Task branch and does not fail or roll back creation.
- A later initiating operation may replace the pending branch while no managed Worktree is bound. Successful binding consumes the then-current pending choice, including a replacement accepted after the materialization snapshot, and makes managed Worktree metadata the sole branch authority.
- After creation, an initiating request may repeat the exact branch recorded in managed Worktree metadata as an idempotent assertion. A different branch is rejected as an attempted rename. This assertion also applies when an overlapping request supplied a post-snapshot replacement before the Worktree bound and encounters that Worktree afterward.
- A custom branch name does not change automatic managed Worktree root naming, which remains based on the Task Short ID.
- Task Worktree creation uses ordinary managed-root collision behavior; its initial branch follows the Task-specific collision rules above.
- Worktree deletion/retargeting treats non-terminal tasks referencing a managed worktree as blockers.
- Worktree deletion fails immediately if any targeting Active Session Runtime is Executing, processing or holding pending Steering, or has selected/begun exact execution. It does not wait for or stop that work.
- A targeting Idle Active Session Runtime is retired before its Session is retargeted as dormant. Durable target/reminder state changes before physical deletion.
- If human input becomes accepted first, that delete attempt fails. If deletion retires and retargets first, later input activates or attaches to a Runtime on the new target.
- A Session without an Active Session Runtime is retargeted in durable metadata and receives one typed model-visible Worktree-change entry.
- A live background process whose Working Directory is inside the Worktree blocks deletion immediately.
- A rejected deletion leaves Session targets, worktree information, Git state, and branch state unchanged.
- Task Worktree creation and conservative restoration use the same setup behavior. Restoration follows the named-branch and root rules above.
- Creation follows the Task-specific collision rules above.
- CLI target overrides, interaction, structured outcomes, and already-started guidance follow [CLI Commands](cli-commands.md#workflow-and-task-mutation).

## Project Keys And Task IDs

- Project keys are uppercase, globally unique within a persistence root, 2-8 chars, and match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,7}$`.
- Project creation chooses a key explicitly; default suggestion can use the first three letters of project name.
- A Project without a Project Key receives one before Kent creates its first Task Short ID. Kent derives the suggestion from the Project name and resolves collisions.
- Project keys are editable at any time, including after a project has tasks. A key change only sets the prefix for tasks created afterward and never rewrites existing task short IDs, so a project's history can contain mixed prefixes. The change is rejected only for format violations or a collision with another project's key.
- Task Short IDs keep the Project Key assigned at creation; a Project Key rename does not cascade to them.
- Task short IDs are stored durable product identifiers, not derived display strings.
- Task required fields are title, short ID, and body.
- A Task can include an optional structured `source_url`.

## Comments

- Agents can add, replace, and delete Task Comments through Task-management commands and APIs.
- There are no model-callable comment tools.
- When `KENT_SESSION_ID` identifies an agent invocation, Task Comment creation must record the agent author kind even if the command requests a user author kind.
- Comments record the author or source agent when available.
- Comments belong to the Task and are not files in its worktree.
- Comment lists order by creation time descending, then Comment ID descending.
- Each Comment list response reports the current total number of Comments independently of its bounded item window.
- Comment listing accepts an optional zero-based, non-negative offset and an optional limit. Omitted offset starts at zero; omitted limit defaults to 100; the maximum limit is 100.
- Each Comment list request is independent and stateless. The server bounds the response by the requested limit and retains no page contents or pagination state.
- A Comment list response includes `next_offset` only when another offset request may return more items; terminal responses omit it.
- Insertions, removals, or reordering between independent Comment list requests may cause later results to repeat or skip items.
- Deleting a Task Comment removes it completely. Kent cannot list or restore deleted Comments.

## Durable Workflow State

- Supported Metadata upgrade normalization of persisted Workflow state follows [Release And Distribution](release-distribution.md#metadata-upgrades).
- A Task owns its Current Nodes, any entering Transition Branch, current inputs, optional Session associations, and pending Approval.
- Current Nodes have no independent product identity.
- Every Agent Current Node materializes and persists its effective Assignee and thinking when it is created.
- The Session resolved as continuation context does not by itself determine the target Assignee.
- An unstarted target that will establish a fresh or compacted Session contract materializes the required target Agent Node fallback. An unstarted retained continuation preserves the retained Session Assignee, treating an absent retained role as Kent's canonical default role.
- A target execution already bound to a Session preserves that Session's Assignee. A pending Approval target has not started and therefore derives its Assignee only from its frozen Context-Preservation Mode and Context Source resolution.
- An Agent Current Node without persisted thinking uses absent/no-thinking. Kent validates preserved role availability when the Current Node starts; an unavailable role produces an ordinary start failure.
- Later Workflow edits do not change an admitted Agent Current Node's materialized Assignee or thinking.
- Current Node read models expose the materialized Assignee and thinking.
- Desktop Task detail renders the materialized Assignee and thinking for Agent Current Nodes and omits them for non-Agent Current Nodes.
- An executable Current Node retains only the state needed to execute or resume. A Script Node has no Session.
- Applying a Transition replaces the source Current Nodes, supplies target inputs, and adds target Current Nodes as one atomic change.
- Kent does not retain applied or rejected Transition history, completed Current Nodes, or execution-attempt records.
- A pending Approval is the only retained frozen Transition. Kent removes it
  after approval or a superseding manual move. Kent has no public Transition
  Approval Reject action.
- A retained Session identifies its Workflow Node and, during parallel work, its Transition Branch Key.
- Project Workflow Links represent active membership only. Unlinking removes an unused link completely.
- A Project cannot unlink a Workflow while Tasks use that link. The error reports blockers with counts and references.
- Deleting a Workflow is the only way to retire it. Workflows and Nodes have no archive state.
- Each Task belongs to one Project through one Project Workflow Link.
- A Project's default Workflow link and primary workspace must belong to that Project.
- Kent derives workspace and worktree display facts from their authoritative roots and Project choices. It does not maintain duplicate editable copies.
- After reconnect or a live-update error, clients reissue Workflow and Task reads and subscriptions. The resulting projections retain the stale-tolerant read contract.
- A Workflow deletion preview reports counts only.
- Workflow deletion requires Quiescence across every affected Task. It also requires a replacement when deleting the Project's default Workflow would leave an invalid default state.
- Confirmed Workflow deletion removes the Workflow, its Project Workflow Links, its Tasks, and its graph as one atomic change.
- Workflow deletion preserves Sessions, worktrees, and other external artifacts. It does not perform individual Task Delete cleanup.
- Task Delete requires Quiescence. It safely removes reconstructible managed artifacts, preserves Session artifacts, and removes the Task only after cleanup succeeds.
- Task Delete removes Task Dependencies according to the Task Dependencies
  contract.
- Repeating Task cleanup for an artifact that is already absent succeeds.
- Saving a Workflow checks the expected Workflow Version, validates the Workflow Draft, reports active blockers, and requires confirmation for destructive removals.
- A successful Workflow save applies details and graph changes as one atomic change.
- Saving a Workflow graph never deletes or moves Tasks.
- Executable context uses the Task, the latest Workflow definition, current inputs, Execution Target, and selected Context Source Session. It does not search discarded execution history.
## Compatibility Data

- A persisted Task whose managed Worktree root equals its source Workspace root is normalized to a locked no-managed-worktree Execution Target. Kent clears the obsolete managed Worktree relation and selected Git revision facts, preserves the Task's Workflow state and Sessions, and uses the source Workspace as its Execution Root.
- Existing unlocked Tasks without a managed Worktree initialize their pending managed branch from their Task Short ID. Tasks with a managed Worktree and Tasks locked to no managed Worktree have no pending branch choice.
- A legacy canceled Task moves to terminal Node `done` when that Node exists.
- If that Workflow has terminal Nodes but no `done` Node, Kent preserves the
  Task's unique valid active terminal when one exists. Otherwise Kent chooses
  one terminal Node deterministically.
- If its Workflow has no terminal Node, Kent removes the Task after making its
  Sessions workflow-neutral and preserves its worktrees and other external
  artifacts.
- `source_url` remains an optional structured Task field.
- Task Short ID remains durable product data.
- Context Source selection uses retained Sessions and does not depend on discarded execution records.
- Pending Approval retains the exact Transition facts that the operator is approving. Ordinary work uses current inputs and the latest Workflow definition.
- When legacy serial state contains a persisted pending Approval and a conflicting serial current position, Kent retains the Approval source as the Task's only Current Node.
- When legacy serial state has no pending Approval and contains several active Start or Terminal Nodes, Kent retains the placement with the latest update time, then latest creation time, then greatest identifier.
- Task Comments retain their author identity when available.
- Session listings retain the first prompt preview.
- Sessions retain unsent input drafts for recovery.
