# Projects And Workspaces

## Relationships

- A Project must retain at least one attached workspace.
- A Project has one default workspace, and that workspace must belong to the Project.
- The same workspace path may belong to several Projects, but it may belong to one Project only once.
- Attaching a workspace creates only the Project-workspace relationship.
- Detaching a workspace removes only the selected Project-workspace relationship.
- Workspace files remain in place when attaching, detaching, or changing the default workspace.
- All other artifacts remain intact after detach, including Tasks, Sessions, worktrees, retained Workflow state, and ordinary Session drafts.
- A Project Workspace catalog covers every Workspace attached to its Project.
- Catalog reads request bounded segments and never request the complete catalog as one unbounded operation.
- Exact Project-scoped path and Workspace ID selection remain available independently of catalog page retention.

## Detach Safety

- Detach requires an explicit Project and one workspace selected by path or workspace ID.
- Path selection is scoped only to the selected Project.
- If a selected Workspace ID no longer exists, detach must succeed without mutation when the selected Project exists. Concurrent repeated detach of that ID must also succeed.
- If a selected Workspace belongs to a different Project, detach must fail without revealing its relationships to other Projects. An unresolved path selector must fail without detaching anything.
- A saved workspace path may be detached while its directory is missing or inaccessible.
- When path identity cannot be recovered, the operator can select the workspace by ID.
- Detach is blocked for a default workspace, including a Project's sole workspace, non-terminal dependent Tasks, live Session execution, worktree dependencies, or missing retained Session location information.
- Detach is allowed when references are only terminal Tasks and retained Sessions whose locations remain readable.
- A blocked or concurrently invalidated detach changes nothing.
- A concurrently invalidated detach reports that retrying is safe.
- Detach returns a bounded blocker summary. It does not list dependent Task, Session, or worktree IDs.
- Detach never requires direct database access.

## API

- The workspace-catalog API uses offset-and-limit traversal and returns at most 100 Workspaces per request.
- The default Workspace is the first catalog row. Remaining rows use newest attachment first.
- Each catalog row contains Workspace identity, name, canonical path, and default status. It contains no availability, Session-count, activity-time, or Git facts.
- Catalog responses contain no separate default-Workspace reference.
- Workspace-catalog reads use stored Project and Workspace facts without inspecting the filesystem or Git.
- The exact Project-scoped Workspace API accepts a Workspace ID or path and returns the lean catalog row with a typed `attached` outcome when that Workspace is attached to the selected Project.
- The exact Project-scoped Workspace API returns a typed `not_attached` outcome when the selected Workspace is not attached to the selected Project.
- The workspace-attach API returns the authoritative Project-workspace binding with a typed `attached` or `already_attached` outcome.
- Project overview and board reads obtain bounded Project, default-Workspace, Workspace-count, and exact source-Workspace facts without loading the Project Workspace catalog.
- The workspace-detach API requires a Project ID and exactly one workspace selector: workspace ID or workspace path.
- The default-workspace API requires a Project ID and exactly one workspace selector: workspace ID or workspace path.
- Workspace-ID requests remain supported.
- Each API operation resolves its selector inside the selected Project and applies the requested change as one operation.
- A resolved detach result identifies the selected Project and workspace.
- A blocked detach returns every blocker with its stable code and count when present. Clients derive human-readable explanations and guidance from typed blocker facts.
- The detach success result contains exactly `project_id` and `workspace_id`.
- The default-workspace success result contains exactly `project`, whose value is the authoritative updated Project.
- Mutation error details contain only `code`, resolved Project/workspace IDs when resolution succeeded, bounded `blockers` when detach is blocked, and `retryable: true` for a concurrent detach conflict.
- Canonical workspace roots are never included in mutation success or error results.
