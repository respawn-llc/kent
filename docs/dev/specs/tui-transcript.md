# TUI Transcript And Interaction Spec

## Modes

- TUI modes are `ongoing` and `detail`, toggled by `Shift+Tab` or `Ctrl+T`.
- Ongoing is the default long-running mode.
- Detail is a fullscreen pager-style transcript overlay where input, queues, and pickers are hidden.
- Mode-toggle events are UI-ephemeral and are not persisted.

## Ongoing Mode

- Ongoing remains minimal: command start previews, file hint previews, lower-contrast syntax-highlighted shell previews, no thinking traces, no preambles, no outputs, and no diffs.
- Ongoing preview sizing is fixed: command max 80, file max 60, soft-wrap allowed.
- Ongoing line prefix is `>`, followed by one space.
- Ongoing does not own a transcript viewport or restore app-managed scroll. Native terminal scrollback owns committed history navigation.
- Main UI startup stays in the normal buffer because ongoing-mode replay must remain visible in terminal scrollback.
- The former `tui_alternate_screen` config is removed; legacy config keys are rejected.
- Startup clears the visible terminal viewport once before rendering so each session starts from a clean visible slate.
- During continuous attachment, ongoing normal-buffer history is append-only.
- Once a transcript line is emitted into scrollback, it is immutable: no retroactive restyling, no in-place rewrites, no clear-and-replay, and no full-buffer re-emission to paper over same-session divergence.
- Compaction is same-session committed transcript progression, not a same-session transcript rewrite.
- User-visible transcript history is never truncated by compaction or handoff.
- Latest-compaction boundary/floor is tail/model metadata only; detail paging and rendering ignore it.
- Legacy persisted `history_replaced` entries with `engine="reviewer_rollback"` are tolerated and ignored as compatibility no-ops.
- Rollback/fork is navigation or attachment to a different session target, not same-session transcript mutation.
- Assistant streaming in ongoing mode uses source-backed Markdown promotion. Stable rendered assistant lines may append before commit; mutable tail stays in live viewport.
- Ongoing scrollback authority is committed transcript plus immutable stable assistant stream promotions. Tool progress and reasoning deltas remain transient live viewport state.
- Runtime-control feedback rows that appear in the transcript are committed by the runtime. Runtime-backed clients must not emit optimistic or transient transcript echoes for those rows; local transcript fallback is limited to sessions without a runtime client or committed-append failures.
- Connectivity/subscription continuity loss discards transient live viewport immediately and recovers by hydrating authoritative committed transcript state.
- Transcript-affecting transport failures must not be swallowed or converted to fake empty/idle state.
- External continuity-loss recovery may re-issue the ongoing buffer from authoritative committed state.
- Client-side transcript divergence from deduplication, ordering, overlap, or pagination bugs is not an acceptable redraw case.
- Pending tool-call activity lives only in the volatile live region.
- Ongoing glyphs reserve `@` for web search and `§` for reviewer status/suggestion entries.
- Pending tool-call previews in live region use the same rendering/layout as committed tool-call previews, with no pending-only labels.
- Tool completion appends exactly one final committed line in transcript order. Ongoing never recolors/mutates an earlier emitted tool line.
- Parallel tool calls commit through a stable frontier: later completed calls remain live until all earlier pending calls are ready.
- In main-input mode, `Up`/`Down` are reserved for prompt-history recall at whole-buffer boundaries or multiline cursor movement. They do not scroll ongoing transcript.
- `PgUp`/`PgDn` also do not scroll ongoing transcript state.
- Ongoing mouse capture is disabled to preserve native text selection.
- Ongoing mode never enables terminal alternate-scroll `?1007`.

## Detail Mode

- Detail mode is an expandable transcript inspector.
- Collapsed detail is default.
- User and assistant messages show at most the first 3 rendered lines when collapsed.
- Tool calls show the same first input line used by ongoing previews.
- Ask-question entries show only the question when collapsed.
- Known developer/context reminders use typed compact labels.
- Expanding reveals full detail content.
- Detail compact labels are metadata-first. Runtime/client projection preserves source message type, source path, compact content/label, and tool presentation metadata.
- Legacy sessions degrade by role and text-preview fallback only. Kent must not parse old prompt/reminder text to reclassify AGENTS, skills, environment, worktree, patch, or handoff messages.
- Unknown roles, unknown message types, and invalid/missing metadata remain visible and expandable when recoverable text exists.
- Detail tool calls with error results stay collapsed by default but may show compact input plus structured error summary.
- Detail scrolling is line-oriented.
- `Up`/`Down` move by one rendered line when viewport can scroll.
- After line, page, wheel, or alternate-scroll movement, compact detail selects the visible selectable item nearest viewport center.
- Tall expanded entries remain selected while their body crosses the center anchor.
- Detail rows do not use dedicated collapsed/expanded glyphs. First rendered line keeps normal role/tool symbol; continuations use faint tree guides.
- Compact detail replaces selected expandable item's role symbol with `▶` or `▼`. The affordance is selected-only.
- Detail status line mirrors selected action as `Enter to expand` or `Enter to collapse`.
- Detail items use blank-line role-group separators. Consecutive tool rows form dense chunks.
- Detail selection uses full-width selected background/fill only and does not change foreground colors.
- Detail is a live transcript view with UI-local expansion and selection. Transcript changes update content while scroll/anchor stays stable unless the user navigates.
- Mid-step entries show latest completed snapshot only.
- Snapshot scope is the full session transcript up to latest completed step.
- Detail rendering is a flat continuous stream with no grouped sections.
- Step-end markers appear in detail only.
- Detail transcript overlay always uses terminal alt-screen `?1049`.
- Detail does not enable terminal mouse capture.
- Detail may enable alternate-scroll `?1007` only while active and must disable it on exit.
- Full-screen overlay surfaces (`/status`, `/goal`, `/worktree`, `/ps`) follow the same rule as detail: they enable alternate-scroll `?1007` while active and disable it on exit, regardless of which transcript mode they were opened from, so the mouse wheel scrolls overlay content.
- Rollback/edit picker uses detail rendering inside alt-screen but does not enable alternate-scroll and ignores mouse events.

## Transcript Visibility

- Transcript visibility is defined by one product matrix, not ad hoc filters.
- Visibility is projection metadata from the runtime output stream, not a separate conversation mutation path.
- Visibility values are `O` full ongoing+detail, `OC` collapsed/short ongoing plus full detail, `D` detail-only, and `X` hidden.
- Unknown/malformed entries with recoverable text are `O`; empty unknown/malformed entries are `D` diagnostics.
- Locked message-type visibility:
- `agents.md`: `D`
- `skills`: `D`
- `environment`: `D`
- `compaction_summary`: `O`, using compact label in ongoing/collapsed detail and full summary on expansion.
- `interruption`: `O`
- `error_feedback`: `O`
- `compaction_soon_reminder`: `D`
- `reviewer_feedback`: represented by reviewer transcript roles, effective `OC` or `O` depending on reviewer verbosity.
- `background_notice`: `OC`
- `handoff_future_message`: `D`
- `manual_compaction_carryover`: `D`
- `headless_mode`: `D`
- `headless_mode_exit`: `D`
- Locked non-message roles:
- user turns: `O`
- assistant turns: `O`
- tool calls: `OC`
- reviewer suggestions/status: `OC` or `O`
- Runtime projection decides whether persisted/runtime messages become transcript entries and which role they use.
- TUI rendering decides how transcript roles behave in ongoing and detail.
- When a concept already has a dedicated transcript role, do not also render its raw developer/request artifact.

## Rendering Pipeline

- Transcript rendering stages are ordered: content render, low-level semantic transform, wrap, line layout, final decoration.
- Formatter config owns syntax backgrounds and formatter base foreground.
- Transcript rendering owns role styling, subdued shell preview styling, and diff semantics.
- Layout owns prefixes, indentation, and wrapping only.
- Semantic color tokens are centralized in `shared/theme`.
- Syntax-highlighted output must not emit backgrounds unless explicitly intended, such as diff add/remove decoration.
- Formatted text uses app foreground as base text color.
- Patch/edit tools use `⇄` in ongoing, detail, and native replay, inheriting result-state color.
- Detail shell commands use full syntax color. Ongoing shell commands are subdued.
- No timestamps are shown in UI.
- Streaming paint cadence is 16ms with token coalescing per flush tick.
- Main status line is compact and fixed: activity indicator, optional git branch, model label, process/server metadata, transient warning, and right-aligned context meter.
- Goal mode does not add persistent goal text. The primary-blue `goal` progress word is visible when the runtime goal SSOT reports an active goal, including at startup, between goal-loop turns, or while runtime-local suspended. Paused, completed, and cleared goals do not show the indicator. Reviewer and compaction indicators keep precedence over goal because they describe immediate blocking activity.
- Context meter is a 10-char bar plus `% ctx window`, green/yellow/red at `<50%`, `50-<80%`, `>=80%`.

## Input And Queueing

- Kent input fields use one shared editor implementation with a real terminal cursor by default across ongoing and alt-screen surfaces.
- `InputField.Render(width)` owns rendered lines and cursor coordinates; callers must not splice unwrapped content into those lines.
- Fallback to soft cursor is allowed only for verified cursor drift, wrap mismatch, or alt-screen corruption that cannot be solved in the renderer adapter.
- Startup/onboarding/project/worktree input fields use `cli/tui/input.Editor` and `cli/tui/input.Field`, not Bubble `textinput.Model`, app-local wrappers, or additional text-input components.
- In-turn user messaging queues typed steering intents for later safe-boundary delivery and supports queued post-turn send.
- Queue/send hotkey is `Tab`; `Ctrl+Enter` is a compatibility alias.
- Known `Ctrl+Enter` CSI encodings normalize to the same queue action.
- Clipboard image paste hotkeys are `Ctrl+V` and `Ctrl+D`; they save clipboard images to temp PNG files and insert the path.
- Mid-run steering is soft-insert only at safe boundaries after current tool completion.
- Steering submissions never lock the input box; each `Enter` while busy queues another steering message.
- Pending steering and pending user messages are strict FIFO.
- Multiple queued user steering messages flushed at one boundary coalesce into one user message separated by blank lines.
- Pending queues are unbounded and in-memory only.
- Injected mid-run messages persist only on delivery boundary.
- Ctrl+C interrupt is turn-local: stop current model step and active tool process, keep app/session alive.
- Interrupt injects detail-only developer-role control message `User interrupted you`.
- Post-interrupt state returns idle with input ready.
- Resume after interrupt requires explicit user text.
- Crash recovery is bifurcated: mid-step crash resumes via interrupt flow; otherwise restore normal state.
- Failed prompt-history navigation emits plain terminal BEL with no transient UI notification.

## Path Autocomplete

- Main-input `@` path autocomplete uses a cached repo-relative corpus built asynchronously from `rg --no-config --files -0 --hidden -g '!.git'`.
- Corpus prewarming starts through Bubble Tea startup commands, not unmanaged constructor goroutines.
- Live matching never shells out per keystroke.
- Query tracking is cursor-local and accepts Unicode letters/digits plus `/`, `.`, `_`, and `-`.
- Hidden paths are included, `.git` is excluded, and normal ignore-file handling remains enabled.
- Non-empty directory candidates are derived from file paths; empty directories are intentionally excluded in v1.
- Corpus-build failures are retryable later in the same workspace and do not permanently disable path autocomplete.

## Startup And Session Selection

- Startup shows recent sessions with pick-or-new flow.
- Startup session list is scrollable with no cap.
- If no sessions exist, startup goes directly to new-session setup.
- When CLI startup cwd does not resolve to a registered project/workspace/worktree, startup enters project picker/registration instead of auto-registering.
- That flow may create a project and attach current workspace as first workspace/main worktree, or attach current workspace to an existing project.
- Outside that flow, CLI remains workspace-first.
- When a session selected from the picker has stored workspace root different from current root, startup shows `Workspace changed` confirmation. `Yes` retargets; `No` returns to picker.

## Worktree Management

- Worktree-management product language uses `workspace`, not `repo`.
- `/worktree` management keeps session identity stable and changes only execution target `(workspace_id, worktree_id?, cwd_relpath)`.
- First `/worktree` slice has no separate teleport-root abstraction.
- `/worktree`, `/worktree new`, and `/worktree create` enter one smart-target create dialog. Raw `/worktree create <branch> [path]` bypass is unsupported.
- Create dialog auto-suggests target name only from sanitized session name. It does not fall back to current branch, main, or generic placeholder.
- Create dialog has no explicit new/existing selector. Kent resolves typed `Branch or ref` asynchronously and shows `new branch`, `existing branch`, or `detached ref`.
- `Branch or ref` appears before `Base ref`. `Base ref` defaults to `HEAD` and is required only for new branch creation.
- Worktree transitions store the latest pending typed developer-context steering intent and materialize it at normal steering priority before the next user/model turn.
- Worktree transitions do not append synthetic transcript notes.
- Git remains source of truth for topology. Kent stores additive metadata and blocks deleting worktrees still targeted by another session.
- Existing non-Kent git worktrees remain manageable and should be visually marked where feasible.
- Supported aliases preserve safety semantics: `/worktree status`, `/worktree ls`, `/worktree remove`, `/worktree rm`.
- Worktree delete is rebind-first cleanup and is blocked while background shell processes still run under that worktree.
- Branch cleanup is conservative/best-effort. Kent only auto-attempts branch deletion when provenance proves it created the branch. Force delete is not part of the first slice.
- New worktrees default under `worktrees.base_dir`, rooted under Kent persistence state by default.
- Live worktree retarget rebinds runtime-local tool handlers to the new effective root.
- Optional post-create setup script is `worktrees.setup_script`, runs async only after new worktree creation, receives args/stdin JSON/env, and failures do not undo worktree/session switch.

## Slash Commands

- Leading slash enters command mode when first non-space char is `/`.
- Picker matches only first token and updates continuously.
- After whitespace, command enters argument mode and picker hides.
- `Enter` runs the selected slash command, including default first match for partial input.
- `Tab` on partial selected command autocompletes it and inserts trailing space.
- Unknown slash commands are sent to the model as normal user prompts.
- Built-ins: `/logout`, `/exit`, `/new`, `/resume`, `/compact`, `/name`, `/thinking`, `/fast`, `/review`, `/init`, `/supervisor`, `/autocompaction`, `/status`, `/ps`, `/copy`, `/back`.
- Exact known slash commands use the normal queued-input drain path when queued; they are never sent as plain user prompts.
- Run-safe commands execute immediately while busy.
- Non-run-safe known commands while busy are rejected with transient status-line error.
- `/copy` copies latest committed assistant `final_answer` and stays hidden until one exists.
- `/review` auto-submits embedded review rubric; it stays in-place for empty sessions and forks fresh child session after a visible user prompt.
- `/back` reopens parent session when available.
- `/supervisor` toggles current-session reviewer invocation and does not persist to config.
- `/autocompaction` toggles runtime auto-compaction for current session and does not persist to config.
- `/fast`, `/supervisor`, and `/questions` toggle feedback is a committed runtime transcript entry in runtime-backed sessions.
- `/status` opens a read-only detail overlay and refreshes progressively.
- Built-in prompt commands use embedded Markdown templates.
- File-backed prompts come from local/global `.kent/prompts` and `.kent/commands`; scan is non-recursive `.md`, namespace precedence is local over global and prompts over commands.
- File command ID is `prompt:<filename-without-extension>` and submits file content verbatim as user message.

## Notifications

- Ring terminal bell when a new `ask_question` is shown.
- Ring on turn end only if the turn executed at least two tool calls.
- Turn-end notification is deferred until queued prompt drain is fully idle.
- Turn-end text includes assistant preview when available, else `<session title>: turn complete`.
- Ask notifications include `<session title>: Question: <question>` or `<session title>: Action required: <question>`.
- `auto` notification method prefers OSC 9 on supported terminals and falls back to BEL.
- OSC 9 notifications still emit a separate BEL.
- OSC 9 is disabled when `WT_SESSION` is set.

## Reviewer

- Post-turn reviewer exists behind config and defaults to `reviewer.frequency = "edits"`.
- Reviewer runs only after completed assistant final handoff and only if the turn executed at least one tool call.
- Reviewer uses more aggressive tool-output truncation than the main-agent path.
- Reviewer contract is minimal JSON `{"suggestions":["..."]}`; invalid payloads are ignored non-fatally.
- If suggestions exist, runtime appends them as developer message and runs one extra main-agent follow-up pass.
- Follow-up noop token is exact `NO_OP`; if emitted, runtime keeps original assistant final answer.
- Reviewer pass is single-shot with no recursive review.
