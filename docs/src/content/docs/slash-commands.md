Press Tab to autocomplete a command, and Enter to autocomplete and send. Press Tab again when command matches fully to **queue** the command. This allows chains like `"commit" -> [Tab] -> "/compact" -> [Tab] -> "/prompts:open_pr" -> [Tab]`.

Goal changes are saved immediately, including during model work. Confirmation means the goal is saved; Kent schedules the model reminder for the next step boundary.

Kent discovers Markdown prompt commands on the server that owns the attached Project Workspace. Remote clients do not read server paths or receive prompt bodies in the command catalog.

The effective roots, in descending precedence, are:

- `<workspace>/.kent/prompts`
- `<workspace>/.kent/commands`
- `<persistence-root>/prompts`
- `<persistence-root>/commands`
- `<persistence-root>/.generated/prompts`
- `<persistence-root>/.generated/commands`

Discovery is non-recursive and includes non-blank `.md` files. The first valid file for each normalized basename wins. IDs lowercase letters, preserve digits, convert whitespace and underscores to one underscore, and discard other characters.

The picker shows a one-line preview made from the first 256 Unicode characters after collapsing whitespace. Markdown punctuation remains unchanged. Prompt bodies are resolved by the server when the command is invoked.

If the exact `$ARGUMENTS` token appears in the body, Kent replaces every occurrence with trimmed trailing arguments. Otherwise, Kent appends non-empty trailing arguments after one blank line.

First-time setup can import slash-command directories from supported providers. An unavailable or unknown `/prompt:` command reports an error and is never sent to the model as plain text. Other unknown slash commands retain their normal behavior.

During an active turn, an available `/prompt:<name>` command steers its server-expanded prompt into the current session. `/review` and `/init` retain their fresh-session behavior.
