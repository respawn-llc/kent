title: Headless runs
description: Headless Kent runs, scriptable output modes, and how interactive Kent uses the same mechanism for subagents.
---

Kent supports a headless, non-interactive run mode via `kent run`.
When the interactive Kent session uses subagents, it does so by launching separate headless Kent runs.
This keeps the subagent path contextual and scriptable: subagent invocations are not new tools and consume no extra tokens in model context.

Run a single prompt:

```bash
kent run --agent fast "summarize the unstaged changes in this repo"
```

Continue an existing headless session:

```bash
kent run --continue <session-id> "<follow-up>"
```

Control an active shared run from another shell or agent:

```bash
kent run steer <session-id> "adjust the next step" # steer a running agent
kent run stop <session-id> # gracefully interrupt the run
kent run wait <session-id> # wait for the model's turn to end
kent run watch <session-id> # report the next question or terminal outcome
```

When a human invokes `kent run steer`, the running Session receives a user message. When another Kent Session invokes it, the running Session receives a developer-role agent steer that identifies the source Session and includes the command form for replying.

Headless `kent run` Sessions cannot create Questions. To inspect or answer a pending Question from an interactive or Workflow Session:

```bash
kent question --session <session-id>
kent question answer --session <session-id> --option 1 --commentary "Additional context"
kent questions --task KENT-335
kent questions answer --task KENT-335 --commentary "Freeform answer"
```

Workflow Tasks can be observed without polling:

```bash
kent task wait KENT-335
kent task watch KENT-335
```

List answered Questions from one Session, newest first:

```bash
kent questions list --session <session-id>
kent questions list --session <session-id> --max-handoffs 1 --json
```

`--max-handoffs` defaults to 25 and counts the current unfinished history window. Question history reads the Session log and can be slow, especially in JSON mode. A Task may retain hundreds of Sessions; use `kent task sessions <task>` to choose a Session before listing its Question history.

These commands are one-shot server-side waits. `wait` ignores Questions but reports the next interruption, error, or terminal completion; `watch` reports the next Question, interruption, error, or terminal completion. A reported Question includes a runnable `kent question answer` command.

Use exactly one of `--session` or `--task`. Task short IDs resolve in the current workspace's Project unless `--project` selects another Project. A Task with pending Questions in several Sessions is ambiguous; Kent answers nothing and lists each candidate Session name and ID.

:::tip
`kent run` needs a server connection to keep long-running shells and agents properly orchestrated. If you want to script kent runs, make sure the [Server](../server/) is running.

## Subagent Roles

Roles are needed to create specialized subagent types for different tasks and workflows. Treat them like different employees or specialists.

`--agent <role>` selects a named subagent role from `[subagents.<role>]` in the local or global config file. `--agent default` clears a resumed role and uses the base settings; `none` and `self` are not run-agent selectors.
To open an interactive session with a role, run:

```bash
kent --agent research
```

To apply a role while reopening a specific session, combine it with `--session` or `--continue`. Unlocked sessions may select another role or clear the role with `--agent default`. If the session has a locked model request shape, the selected role must match the persisted role and `--agent default` cannot clear it.

Example subagent config:

```toml
[subagents.research]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
thinking_level = "xhigh"
system_prompt_file = "research-agent.md"
description = "Use when you need fast, smart general-purpose researcher for deep thinking or complicated plans."
priority_request_mode = true
agent_callable = true
workflow_subagent = true

[subagents.research.tools]
patch = false

[subagents.research.skills]
"kent-dogfooding" = false
```

- Set `agent_callable = false` to disallow agents to call that subagent role on their own.
- Set `workflow_subagent = false` to disallow workflow agents from calling that custom role.
- The built-in `fast` role exists even without config.
- Subagent roles inherit the main config and then override only the keys you set in that role table.

Useful role-specific keys include:

- `model`, `provider_override`, `openai_base_url`, etc.
- `thinking_level`, `model_verbosity`, `priority_request_mode`
- `system_prompt_file`
- `description`, `agent_callable`
- `workflow_subagent`
- `[subagents.<role>.tools]`
- `[subagents.<role>.skills]`

For the full list of shared overrides, see [Configuration](../config/).

## Delegation Depth

Kent limits model-originated creation of new child agents. A root session is depth `0`; with the default maximum of `2`, a root can create a subagent at depth `1`, that subagent can create one at depth `2`, and creation of a child at depth `3` is rejected.

The same limit applies across role changes and to delegation initiated by workflow agents. Scheduler-created workflow sessions start at depth `0`. Derived sessions such as `/new`, `/review`, rollback forks, and workflow fan-out clones preserve their source's agent ancestry.

The policy applies only when creating a new model-originated child. Opening or continuing an existing session is unchanged. Kent reads the active effective configuration for each attempt, rejects an over-limit launch before creating its session, and tells the current agent to stop trying subagents and complete the task itself.

Configure the root-level TOML key, supported range, and disable-with-zero behavior in the [configuration reference](../config/#core-settings). There is no environment-variable or `kent run` flag override.

## Session Behavior

Headless runs are non-interactive. They do not stop to ask the human operator questions mid-run, issue tool preambles, or support the Supervisor. That makes them more suitable for background execution, automation, and saves tokens. You can talk to a headless agent if you select it in the `/resume` (session picker).

## Workspace Binding

Headless runs fail if the selected workspace is not already attached to a Kent project.
This is needed to enable functionality related to project management and allows remote execution, but sometimes comes as a limitation where you want to run subagents in different repos. To fix the error, you simply need to approve workspace (git repo, folder etc.) binding:

- `kent project` prints the project id for the bound workspace at `path` or `cwd`. Use to learn project IDs.
- `kent attach <path>` attaches another workspace at [path] to the project already bound to `cwd`.
- `kent attach --project <project-id> [path]` attaches using the ID.
- `kent detach --project <project-id> [path]` removes one workspace binding from that project. The path defaults to the current directory; use `--workspace <workspace-id>` when the saved path is inaccessible or missing.
- `kent project default --project <project-id> [path]` changes the project's default workspace. It accepts the same path or workspace-ID selector and applies immediately.
- `kent rebind <session-id> <new-path>` retargets a session while keeping its source project and attaches an unbound target workspace to that project.
- `kent rebind --project <project-id> <session-id> <new-path>` moves a non-workflow session to another project and attaches an unbound target workspace.

For a live session, Kent acknowledges the scheduled move and applies it between agent steps, preserving the running agent and queued input even across projects. Existing background commands continue in their original directories; new commands use the destination. Dormant session moves complete synchronously and reject running session-owned background commands.

Detach and default-workspace selection require an explicit project ID. Path selectors are converted to absolute server paths before the request. A shared path can be detached from one project without changing its binding in another project.

Use `--json` for automation. Successful detach returns `status: "ok"` with `project_id` and `workspace_id`; successful default selection returns the updated project at `result.project`. Operational failures return one `status: "error"` object with a stable error code. Detach blockers include bounded guidance; a default-workspace blocker directs you to choose another attached workspace with `kent project default`.

Detach error codes are `project_not_found`, `workspace_not_attached`, `workspace_detach_blocked`, `workspace_detach_conflict`, and `request_failed`. Default-workspace selection uses `project_not_found`, `workspace_not_attached`, and `request_failed`. JSON omits absent results, error identities, blocker counts, and retryability fields.

Detach blockers use these recovery actions:

- `default_workspace`: choose another attached workspace with `kent project default`, then retry.
- `active_sessions`: stop active runs or rebind their Sessions, then retry.
- `non_terminal_tasks`: move editable Backlog Tasks to another source workspace, or complete, manually move, or delete dependent Tasks, then retry.
- `executable_current_nodes`: stop execution and move, complete, or delete affected Tasks until no executable Current Node uses the workspace, then retry.
- `managed_owned_worktrees`: delete dependent worktrees or their quiescent owning Tasks, then retry.
- `missing_history_snapshot`: re-save the editable Task's source workspace; keep the binding if its history cannot be edited.

### Project deletion

Delete a Project by its canonical Project ID:

```bash
kent project delete <project-id> --confirm
```

Project deletion is non-interactive and accepts only the canonical Project ID. The command checks for unfinished Tasks before checking `--confirm`. An agent-shell invocation is human-only when the Project contains any non-terminal Task, including a Backlog Task; it reports the Project ID and does not request deletion. Task state may change before deletion is processed, and the server's deletion blockers remain authoritative.

Without `--confirm`, the command makes no deletion request. Use `--json` for automation; it emits one `status` envelope on `stdout`, with the canonical Project ID in `result.project_id` on success or `error.project_id` on operational failure. Blocked deletion preserves server blocker codes, messages, order, and positive counts. Blockers and other operational failures exit nonzero.

Stable deletion error codes are `confirmation_required`, `human_only_unfinished_work`, `project_not_found`, `project_delete_blocked`, and `request_failed`.

Project deletion never deletes or moves workspace files.

## Output Modes

By default, `kent run` writes each finalized assistant commentary or final response to `stdout` as it is committed. Use `--quiet` to suppress live output and print only the terminal result. For scripting, use JSON mode:

```bash
kent run --output-mode=json "summarize the repo" | jq
```

JSON mode emits exactly one final object on `stdout`.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": "...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "session_name": "...",
  "continue_id": "...",
  "continue_command": "kent run --continue ... \"follow-up\"",
  "warnings": ["..."],
  "duration_ms": 1234
}
```

On failure, JSON mode emits `status: "error"` and an `error` object instead of `result`.

An over-limit child launch uses the stable `subagent_max_depth_exceeded` code and includes the attempted depth and active maximum:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "duration_ms": 0,
  "error": {
    "code": "subagent_max_depth_exceeded",
    "message": "subagent launch rejected at depth 3 (maximum 2): ...",
    "attempted_depth": 3,
    "max_depth": 2
  }
}
```

Because the child was never created, this response has no session ID or continuation command. Final-text mode prints the actionable policy message instead.
