// Package brand is the single source of truth for product identity.
//
// Every user-visible name, on-disk directory, environment-variable prefix,
// OS service identifier, and distribution URL derives from the constants here.
// Keeping identity centralized means a future rebrand (or this one) is a
// localized change instead of a repository-wide string sweep, and prevents the
// identity values from drifting out of sync across subsystems.
//
// Values that are intentionally NOT here:
//   - The old "builder" identifiers retained only for migration shims live with
//     the migration tooling, not as product identity.
//   - The native desktop bundle identifier ("sh.kent") is owned by the Tauri
//     config; it is already final and platform-bound.
